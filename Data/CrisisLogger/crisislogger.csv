10,so high our experience so far has been a little bit difficult when you have a teenage child that is stuck in the house for five to six weeks so far I mean homeschooling you know but her friends has been very hard to see them when you see them on FaceTime working from home is difficult or so after what I was wearing on you I wouldn't mind working from home maybe twice a week every day for six days at 6 weeks if that's difficult communicating it's it's just it's a very hard thing but I think it's been harder on my teenage daughter more she's more seems more secluded now and not as happy and I have to go outside and walk the dog occasionally so she can get fresh air and feel like she's able to do something I encouraged her to work but everyone needs some physical contact just to be around people I mean it's just nature but will hopefully get well soon and hopefully everything will be back to normal again hopefully everyone can stay healthy and safe
209,I'm not going to stay in my name for the anonymity but I am in my mid-forties remotely working from home working for a private Institution my world became very very active lately because of the market conditions and there are more demands and more work required for me to spend less time with my children when they need me I have three children I have a 5th grader ten-year-old I have a third grader a year a three year old and I have a Pre-K 3 4 year old my husband lost his King Kong because the service is not honor are not essential and therefore he's basically home yet he's a double or person who needs to be in the field and it became very frustrating on Olive my children are confused frightened their mental state is not as well because they're hostile we are living in a 650 square feet Apartment 2 bedroom and combine living room with the letter kitchenette that living species was fine with us for us in the past because children were doing all kinds of activities soccer running swimming and being constantly outdoorsy all of the discount now my oldest one is independent but he became depressed it doesn't move much in the morning we need to push him out of his bad to where he's doing his homework so he can stretch out a little bit my middle one he's the fidget one he's the one with ADHD he's not able to focus he's constantly finding toys for himself to play as opposed to doing his school work my husband needs to spend time next to him and constantly cure him back into the school work did my husband is not a teacher and english-as-a-second-language he doesn't even have a college degree I'm not able to spend any time educating my child because if I do not be if I'm not focused on my work I will lose my job and the only source of income for our survival my youngest one is basically being put in front of the TV so he doesn't bother my other two children who need to do the school work when he becomes tired of the TV then he starts teasing my other children where he becomes becomes very loud he throws the Tantrums he doesn't want to eat he's just looking for a Suites to suit him down and basically every day he's asking when he's going back to school and why he needs to stay at home all my children were used to do a routine going to school and literally running through the school yard and looking forward to meeting with their friends and learning something new every day in school in the social environment they enjoyed playing in the schoolyard after school and going into their activity everything was taken away from us I would like this lock sound be over I would want for our country to be opened as soon as possible and as an example looking at them Sweden who took the other way around exposing their Nation to the virus in a natural way in developing the immunity I understand the available in elderly needs to be protected and separated but for us and the children were not at risk they should go to school and an end have their mental state be looked at because this is Yvonne president and on them thank you very much for listening
216,so far I have been florentines now for about a month-and-a-half and it's been tough there seems to be I mean I've been in here in New York and it's been a pretty desperate situation it's been difficult to feel like I can provide some help at all and it kind of seems I feel somewhat helpless however following the news has been it's actually been pretty depressing it's been difficult to follow up and trying to stay away from the news I'm just to try to maintain more hope and try to keep myself removed from the date day of the the virus in the crisis as I don't in feeling that I I can't really help all that much I don't feel like there's any utility in my following the news religiouslybut that being said I have seen you know some hopeful stories from people and seen some some nice things that have enough kind of helped out through the crisis and it's it feels like people are coming together and in a certain way and I hope that people are kind of are realizing that things are unfair in life and in the way that our society works and that's that they don't need to be unfair that we can that this is something that that can be fixed and I hope that that's that's happening however I have my doubts and I worry thatwe'll come out of this is the further entrenchment of class and moneyed interests and in the further entrenchment of the disparity between the ruling in the wealthy class and the rest of us I'm however I also have hope that this is going to kind of wake people up in that this will be the impetus for major social change as it has in the past and I hope so I am hopeful for that however I know that there's is a lot sitting in the way of that sin a lot that. That could prevent that and that's scary because moving forward from this I think that's this thing's could only things can get much worse going forward and I think that the entrenchment of capital and of money to interest will continue and what will consolidate even further as a result of this and if it does then it's going to be even harder to break through that but we're able to to move past that into to wake up and establish a collective conscience and among working people and I think that we can make it through this
222,it has actually been a very difficult. Trying to get adjusted to changes the school system's now became online jobs people have to start working from home sometimes and some other times they have to work at the exact location worrying about family members whether they're okay or not and then family members on the Frontline worrying about them as wellit's been very difficult to me that sounds like China's involvement and I wish the government would do something about a good down to the root of the problem because too many times with the guy versus from China and what is going on
228,so this whole situation has been strange for us we feel very lucky because while we've been laid off or unemployment has with the additional money coming in at least been close to what we were used to making so we're not feeling the strain financially as some of our friends and family are and we're very grateful for that however I think right now because we can stay at homeour biggest fear is what comes next right now we're not scared that we're going to get sick because we are following the guidelines and staying home as much as possible but what worries us is what the world looks like next what the next steps are it makes me nervous to have to send the kids back to school and it makes me nervous to know what it'll be look like going back to work I work as a server in a restaurant and I'm not only worried about what it'll be like workingit in a restaurant during the aftermath of covid-19 but also financially what that'll look like and what our world in general will look like so while we feel lucky at the moment we also feel a little bit stressed out about what the future holds
246,my name is Simi and since the covid virus has come out I have a senior in high school who is depressed his graduation is cancelled from senior college shirt day has been trying to keep busy he lost his job so I did take your advice and I ordered some puzzles and a bunch of games for family activities which have been very helpful he really enjoys mankala and then my other son is in college who came home early becausebecause the college is on closed he is depressed not working just home with really no ambition or motivation I had the coronavirus and so that was challenging in the house with the kids just being kind of quarantine to my room and not feeling well and being able to go to the store quick note my husband did get a job he was unemployed so financially that was a big help andhistoric winning cuz it turned off so I think that that is about our experience with it
342,My fear is that my son will be emotionally impacted by the virus. I worry that he could develop fears associated with this. I fear for my loved ones who tested positive and pray that they will get better. I am scared to take my children outside especially now that the Kawasaki disease is linked to corona virus in children. What has been getting me through this is volunteering as a crisis counselor and taking two long walks a week while covering my face with a mask. I hope and pray we survive this pandemic and can go back to a safer new normal.
349,"Teachers are struggling to support students remotely. This introduces challenges in preparing educational materials that translate from the classroom to a computer, and competing with the distractions they and their students face at home."
376,"I personally hate Distance Learning. I hate that I am missing my 8th grade graduation, I hate that I am missing all of these fun activities that we do at the end of the year, such as Hamilton, Great America, etc. It sucks that I cannot interact with my friends. I Zoom call, but it is not the same. COVID is nobody's friend, but despite how much I have, I still complain to my friend, who has her own issues going on, on top of listening to my issues. But she listens nevertheless, and reassures me...I feel like there is something she isn't telling me-she has been pretty distant with her text messages lately. So I worry for her, I worry for myself and my family, I worry for all pf the frontline workers. This whole thing sucks, but I know it is much better than the alternative."
392,"I feel anxious often and unsure about my abilities as a teacher to meet the needs of my students in this new virtual setting. I see parents struggling with their new roles of trying to manage their childrens studies, work and continue keeping the household together. I struggle to keep up with learning all of the new technology necessary for our changing world. I wonder if I am doing enough. I find it hard to communicate on zoom sometimes. I miss the classroom and being surrounded by children. I became a teacher because I love children. I love to be around them. I feel invigorated by their excitement for life and the wonder they have for learning. I see my students struggling. They miss their school. They miss their friends. I have learned a lot through the pandemic. I have learned how strong we all are and how creative and innovative we can be. I have learned to collaborate and the importance of sharing our feelings. I feell uncertain about the future. But I am certain I will continue to support families and children as we get through this together."
394,"The ambiguity surrounding this virus creates amxiety, confusion and irritation. When will schools open? Will there be a vaccine? Could a second wave happen next school year? I think schools and the government have to be as clear as possible and inform better. Communication builds comfort."
395,"This quarantine is so difficult for teenagers, who should be learning how to be independent young adults but instead are stuck at home with families. What I have not seen addressed is how especially difficult it is for only children. They are all alone with their parents. No other kids to interact with or break the monotony. A school guidance counselor suggested virtual hangouts, but my teen finds that a very poor substitute for spending time with friends. I would appreciate it if someone would address how being an only child increases the isolation of these difficult days."
397,"Trying to work with focus while feeling guilty that my daughter isn’t being mentally stimulated enough, without schooling."
406,I’m pretty bored. And I miss my friends. And I’m nervous for what lies ahead and how this virus will effect my future.
410,I fear that we will not be able to enjoy a normal summer due to the corona virus. I wish I was able to go outside and hang out with friends without having to worry about a global pandemic. It’s also frustrating that teachers have given more schoolwork than usual because we’re at home. Whats been helping me get through this is the fact that i’m able to facetime my friends and use my phone to contact the people i’m closest with.
412,I miss my family. I’m the only one living in the US in my family and everyone is on the other side of the globe. We follow the news of each other’s countries and not being apart makes us worry about each other. We remedy with constant face time. I look forward to seeing my family when this is over.
413,"I spent the whole week tutoring and teaching via Zoom and never talked about the virus with my students. I allow them to be in that bubble away from news updates. 

Of course I think about whether that is the right strategy or not. 

The students seemed ok and motivated. They never asked any questions or shared any thoughts about the pandemic. 

Again, may be this crisis us easier on them than us. Or may be we express emotions and concerns better than they do."
415,"I am afraid that the country is irrevocably changed and things will never return to “normal”
And I might not want some things to return to the way they were (we can do better), but I do want them to return to a feeling of normal. 
I’m worried about losing my job or having to let my employees go. I’m worried that this will create a life for my son that I never imagined or wanted and I can’t give him the life I planned for him."
417,This has changed my life forever. In negative and positive ways. I have a 18 month old daughter that I'm so worried about. She doesn't have other children around which I'm worried will affect her in the long run. My husband and I moved to my mother and step dad house when she was born due to financial problems. My whole family is scared and cramped. Luckily all three work. However I'm alone with my daughter all day with no break. I am bipolar so the fear and anxiety is double the average person. Love has kept me strong throughout this pandemic. It has also strengthened my family in many ways. I just wonder what world will my daughter grow up in?
422,"I'm an expat working in Malaysia. Now I can't go back to my country and don't know when I can. My boyfriend can't visit me here also. I can go out theoretically but if I do go, I have to go through 14 days quarantine in Thailand. It's impossible for me to do so. 14 days are greater than my annual leave quota. I miss him so bad."
423,"I need a break. My husband works out of town and has only come for 5 days the last two months. I get a break when I go out for groceries or other occasional chores. I also work from home. It feels like I am constantly doing, doing, go, go, go. I just want alone time to just be, no duties, just be."
425,"For me during COVID there were two opposite reactions:
1.fear for friends and family that something can happen with them and I won't be able to help, as much as I could;
2.frustration, that I could help only with some data analysis, rather than with a real physical help;
3.at the same time, i finally had time to work on research projects and articles I could not work on before confinement, i managed to continue and advance some projects with far-away collaborators, since ""far"" became a bit closer."
430,I am grateful that my family is healthy. I am thankful for this time with all my children. They are young and growing fast so I’m slowing down to enjoy them as they are. More than anything I feel anxious. Some days I feel like I’m holding my breath all day just waiting for bad news. I am tired. More tired than I’ve ever been in my life. I am angry that this is happening and will continue to happen because of decisions that are outside of my control. I am sad that my kids are missing school and friends and cousins. My twin babies are changing each day and no one gets to see them. I am resistant to this “new normal” while also following all the guidelines religiously. I feel confused and scared.
433,"I am worried about the school kids not going outside at all. It's been 2 months now without school and many studemts here in New York City and suburbs have not been out once in 2 months. That to me is extreme. Many of them cramped up in small apartments. What are the emotional, physical and spiritual effects of such lack of outdoor activities and socializing. Was it even worth it to close the schools? Some countries never did. What damage has been done?"
435,"I’m a woman, aged 63 (almost 64) and still working full time because of the change in the pension age. I was hospitalised with Swine flu in 2009 and it had a big effect on my health. I was diagnosed with asthma in 2010. My lungs have never fully recovered from the severe case of Swine flu. 
I normally work nine to five and there’s have been times over the past two years when I’ve felt very tired and weary. But it wasn’t until this pandemic hit that I actually felt old for the first time in my life. I’ll admit that I went into a blind spin panic when I realised how bad this pandemic was at the end of March. Stress being one of the triggers for my asthma, the feeling of dread and tightness in my chest caused my asthma to peak. I remembered how ill i was in 2009 and the feeling that I just wanted to die and due to my weakened lungs I couldn’t shake the fear. I rang my doctor (not wanting to visit the surgery) and she advised I double up my asthma medication and issued a prescription for extra supplies. My son went to pick it up from the pharmacy the next day, only to discover they couldn’t get supplies of my usual medication. Another call to my doctor and she prescribed an alternative to the medication I had been on since 2010 and my initial asthma diagnosis. A few days later my wheezing had eased but I found I was suffering from severe reflux at nights. So bad it almost choked me on a few occasions, thus adding to my considerable stress. Another call to my doctor, who said the reflux was caused by stress so I was given acid suppressants and signed off work until everything could settle down a bit. I work for a train operating company so I am considered a key worker. 
In summary, I have found the last six weeks to be the most stressful weeks of my life. I’ve always considered myself to be as fit and able as my younger colleagues but this crisis has made me realise I need to take better care of myself and not put my job first. This virus has reminded me that I am getting old."
436,screen and now I'm going to do a test for Harold let's see if that this transcribes and creates a word cloud cloud cloud cloud cloud test for Harold Harold Harold Harold
436,"It's now 2 months into quarantine. I had a bad anxiety attack last night. It was the first since this has been going on. All the uncertainty of the future hit me suddenly. It's hard to make a routine for the day when I can't even take my kids to the park. They miss playing with other children. It's not the same for my preschooler doing any of his work or seeing his friends through a screen. Online learning isn't something that works for my preschooler. My 2 year old doesn't seem to be affected as much because he doesn't understand what's going on. Hours have been cut at both of my jobs in the ER because it's so slow, so money is becoming a worry. My husband has been able to work his normal business hours and get out of the house more, but who knows if that'll ever change. It's hard to talk with him about my concerns because he deals with things internally, whereas I need to talk with someone, but you can't even have a face to face with a counselor. It's insane to think that living literally stopped this time whereas this never happened before with anything else in my lifetime, from swine flu to even 9-11. Does hiding out and living in fear stop this virus from spreading further? Why couldn't people wash their hands before? Thousands of people die of the flu every year, but why do people still go to work sick and not care then? Did the media and politics really drive us into this? How do we get back into living?"
441,"I'm a single mother of a 13 year old. I am fortunate to still have a full time job, but unfortunate to not be with my son to be with him in this very difficult time. While I'm at work he's alone most of the time (just with our dog which might help him a little bit). His father, my husband, passed away 6 years ago so he's gone through a lot already. His dad's grandmother is 66 and has some health problems so she comes to see him on most days when she can and stays for a while in the afternoon until I get home. I'm grateful to her for that, but knowing that he's not in school and doesn't spend any time with his friends makes him sad even though he doesn't tell me. He's not motivated to get his grades up in school because he knows that he'll get promoted to high school either way. I know that that's true, but I tell him that he still should do his work because high school might be the same way it's being taught now and it would be better if he's used to it. That's when he gets frustrated and starts to cry. (This has happened a few times in the past). I don't know what to do so I stop talking and just try to listen to him. That's all I do. Don't know what else to do."
442,"It has been very challenges for us. In the beginning of March, I have been diagnosed with breast cancer. Cancer diagnosis along is lonely and frustrating, especially if you are under 40 with kids ( I feel I am the youngest one in cancer center) and then COVID-19 happen. My treatment plan got impacted but at least I am getting some treatment and doctors are doing everything to help me. Additionally, my mom's knee replacement surgery got postponed and she is now can only jump on 1 leg... My FIL surgery to reverse colostomy bag after his cancer treatment is post postponed and we cannot see my in laws as we are afraid of COVID. My 5th grader will miss his graduation and misses his friends who will be going to different school next year. My preschooler is very active and I am thankful that we have the backyard. So it is a lot to handle. On top of it, both my hubby and I are working from home now. We do not have private office at home and since we are working for non profit international organization, work load increased. We are lucky enough to stay employed during this time and my employer is very flexible for me to take time off for treatment. We also have big family and good friends. We do zoom meetings with cousins, friends, etc regularly. We also do virtual zoomba classes and  exercise bike. We spend a lot of time on our backyard. We are cooking and baking more which is good because I cannot loose weight to continue with my treatments. Our 5th grader became less picky eater and tries everything now. We do family movie nights, gazing the stars nights, backyard clean up party., dance away party and during the day when i do not feel well, we play who takes best care of mommy game. It helps that kids' teachers have meetings with kids so they can feel connected. Our son goes to SKYPE Saturday school for extra activities and our daughter does hip hop classes over zoom. We also"

443,"This is the middle of May. We've all come so far since March. It feels like a marathon. I've never been more glad that I already homeschool my son. I've never missed TJ Maxx so much. I have never wanted a law passed to require face masks for EVERYONE in public until now. I have never been so grateful that my family isn't sick. I've never been more okay with Atlanta traffic than I was today. It's so much better than driving through a deserted city. I've never wished for politics to play less of a role in general safety as I do now. I've never been more thankful for my extremely close proximity to nature. I've never been more glad that I moved far away from a city, to a place with bad Wifi. I've never been so happy about making as many memories as possible because they've kept me sane these past few weeks. I've never understood ""take it one day at a time"" more than I do now. I don't think this event will ever fade from my memory."
444,"My child's teachers are doing what they can to do online instruction, but even with an introverted indifferent student like my son, the need for human presence, for resonance with other bodies as part of learning, is irreplaceable. I hope the Child Mind Institute can take leadership in articulating the harms posed by the fetish for instructional technology prompted by billionaire faux-philanthropists to our neurodiverse kids and to all children. My quirky kid is happy to sit in his room. But it's bad for him and traumatic for other kids-- and we'll be paying the price for years."
446,"I went on maternity leave in January, gave birth at the beginning of Feb. and struggled to breast feed. Once the pandemic hit and everybody panic bought, I was terrified I would not be able to get formula for my child. This created an added layer of stress to my breastfeeding and pumping attempts. Overall, I’m Still only able to provide her half her food, but the stress was overwhelming and Terrifying to wonder if your newborn will have food and you can do nothing on your own to give it to her. Beyond all this, she was not able to meet any family. She might be a year old before it’s safe to travel or meet anyone and my family will miss out on her infant months. Furthermore, there is an even greater stress of work. My whole work environment has changed and I have no idea what I will be going back to. I haven’t been to a store since Feb. everybody is wearing masks and I cry thinking this is “normal”. Even further still, out daycare was closed because they didn’t have enough essential workers to keep the doors open. How will I manage going back to work without child care? Is it even safe to put my child in child care facilities? The stress, depression, anxiety are all overwhelming. Words can’t adequately describe the pain, the panic, and the angst I feel daily."
447,"Directly before the Covid crisis I earned my Master's Degree in Clinical Mental Health Counseling. I finished my internships and licensure exam, while I was pregnant with our second child. Our first child is a boy who is seven, eight this summer. At around the middle of my pregnancy with our now daughter, I became very ill and basically quarantined to our couch. I was unable to begin working at the hospital I completed my second internship. So before any of this even happened I was confined, sick and restless. On February 5th, 2020, I gave birth to a healthy, beautiful baby girl... right before all hell broke loose. We made it home and had one or two visitors before we decided to completely isolate ourselves from the world. The isolation orders had not yet been set, but we told everyone we were concerned enough about Corona and the common flu to not have anyone over to meet our newest family member. Then the actual orders were given and things everywhere began closing. My husband was told to work from home for the foreseeable future, and I was catapulted into the role of home school teacher with a newborn in my arms. I was sleep deprived. I didn't physically or mentally feel like myself. I hadn't been out of the house in an amount of time I couldn't even calculate, and all of a sudden we were trapped with a dog, a cat, close neighbors, a second grader with advanced work, a bread winner who had just turned his only office into a bright coral nursery, a frazzled second time mom, and a newborn. It was chaos. The worst, saddest part, we were some of the luckiest people we knew. Many were forced to still be on the front lines. Friends lost their jobs or were laid off. Hair dresser friends were told not to work and were not given unemployment. Others had even more children to home school. Some had both parents still working and no one to provide childcare. Everyone was scared. Everyone was uncertain and angry out of fear. I utilized my mom as an impromptu phone therapist for myself and was a therapist for many friends. Did I forget to mention that just as my daughter was born my student loans became due? Yeah, and we didn't technically qualify for any type of interest free deferment because we weren't directly impacted by Covid as none of us had it and my husband, who was the sole earner before this happened, was still able to work from home. So I had to put my massive student loan debt into hardship forbearance and I am still accumulating crazy interest. I cannot yet go back to work as I was going to work in a hospital and I am terrified of bringing Covid home to my young children due simply to my work locale. I also have no one able to watch out son, or, more importantly, home school him on the 437 websites he's required to log into every single day, help on zoom meetings he should be attending, or check hard copy papers that make me hate common core mathematics. Everything and everyone has been in a constant state of stress. Our son was a jolly baby who rarely cried and smiled constantly. Our daughter seems more fussy and quicker to be displeased as if she's absorbing this terrible time she was born into. I hate that. Worse than anything I hate the impact this will have on my children. I have discussed things profusely with my son (as, again, I am in mental health) and he's doing wonderfully with it all. I'm very proud of him. But I know he's watching too much television or kids YouTube when I need to get a feeding in for the baby. I know he's not getting outside enough as I can't lay down my infant or she refuses to sleep and having a friend come help out for an hour here and there just isn't an option. I believe he'll be fine through all of this. I worry more about our daughter. Even though she's over three months now and technically out of the ""high risk"" stage for infants, she is still very young and susceptible in my mind. What happens if my son is allowed to go back to school in the fall and he brings EVERYTHING home to her? What kind of world will she grow up in? Will MY debt crush her? Will I ever be able to work and send her to be watched by others without fear? Will she ever get to go shopping in a shopping mall or go physically see a movie in a theater? Will this have irreparable effects on her mental health and overall happiness? Is she now wired for stress and negativity? (Despite my ability to teach her how to fight them.) I have no idea the answers. Will things get worse? Will my children even want to bring their own children into this world if it is worse? This brings up the question of security of our genealogical line? Will we have grandchildren? Will all of society have imploded by then, considering how well we did with a simple toilet paper shortage? The spiraling questions are endless. The spiraling questions my future clients will be asking themselves for the next couple decades will be even more.
I commend Dr. Koplewics for gathering anecdotal research during this time. If nothing else, you served as a mock CBT journaling assignment for anyone willing to participate.
Thank you, and best of luck,

449,"I worry that the excessive screen time (particularly video games) will have a lasting negative impact on my 7 year old. He is obsessed with playing and despite being really active and creative the first couple of months, he has now been spending upwards of 7 hours playing each day now. I work from home, have a 20 month old sand my husband is a nurse living elsewhere for the past few months while treating vivid patients - I don’t have the strength to limit the games but I worry if I don’t it will be an unbreakable Gabor once things return to normal."
453,"Please, please, when this has all come to pass, and school resumes, please don't only focus on ""catching your children up"" academically. Their mental health needs may be extraordinary and each child will be unique. Encourage play and be playful with your children and students, even the ""big kids."" - from a Licensed Professional Counselor, Child & Adolescent Therapist (working with children ages 3 and older)"
456,"I am worried about my daughter, who is changing schools, and starting high school in the fall. She has an autoimmune disorder as well as psychological problems that are contributing to extreme anxiety right now for both of us. Will she be safe if the schools open in the fall?
We are very lucky that we left our home in CT in early March and have been living in a relatively unaffected area of Florida. There’s few people but lots of wildlife and blue skies. I feel very fortunate to wake up to such beauty everyday."
461,hi so my name is Jane and I have a son who's a first-year student at Elon University he's 18 years old and unfortunately he's home because of the virus and where I thought he would really be very upset because he was so incredibly involved with the school lots of friends a girlfriend he also did a lot of extracurricular activities as well as he has a job on campus for he is a tour guide but surprisingly he's been very dedicated to his studies he does his online courses he even goes the extra yard and learns additional things for school he's applying for a scholarship at the University and he still surprisingly getting paid by the university and doing virtual tours and so I think he's very pleased about that and he's actually surprisinglyreally being very productive and very positive during the day he does his school work and then in the evening we have dinner together as a family the two of us and we talked about our day because during the day we're sort of like two ships passing in the night I'm very busy with my illustration work and we doing to do list it'll knock your nose off and in the evening we get together and we talked about our day and that's been you know very nice she regularly runs now every day and then at the end of our dinner we sort of wrap it up and I'll get to my own things and walk the dog in that sort of thing and he gets on the phone with all of his Elon college friends and I can hear him just laughing and having a great time for hours on end in a while I'm going to bed in the evening so I would saysurprisingly he's doing very well he does not see an end of this in anytime which is unfortunate I think he does have a lot of remorse as to his first year of college and all the parties and dances that we're going to happen this spring and sporting events and just all of these wonderful opportunities that are now lost but you know he is making the best of it and in fact per his request through taking a drive into Manhattan and we're going to the rockaways and we're going all over just to see how desolate area is and unlike some of his friends were I've heard that kind of snuck out of the house to go do things with their friends he's been exceptional at Social distancing and taking it all very seriouslyand that's it he also has his regular therapy sessions with his therapist but via I guess phone conversation so that's every other week cuz there's not a lot happening and so he's keeping up with his mental health and yeah I just I just really hope he and his friends and all these kids can get back to school in the fall I think we're adults like myself I think we can pretty much cope and manage very well I think it's a real great Interruption and young people's lives and yeah I guess that's it always is pretty well and making the best of a bad situation isn't it thanks
461,"I'm very sad for my children.  They are losing a lot of school and social experiences.  I would rather be safe than rush into a return to life.  But, I am so depressed about this crisis."
462,"I am frustrated by the lack of concern of others. I avoid people and wear a mask in public. As I see others having parties and not wearing masks, I feel angry at the selfishness of others. I am also worried about school starting in the fall. I don’t want my kids to go to school but I have to work, so I have no choice. Thankfully, I have been able to get paid while staying home. I don’t know what I would have done if I had to keep working."
465,good morning I have a couple of things that I'm a little frustrated with the grown up situation that way and right now I have two girls that I was supposed to graduate one from high school and one from 8th grade and I really frustrates me that they don't get to experience that you know something that you know others have especially my one from high school she works so hard Junior High all the way up high school great grades and she doesn't get a prom and it just frustrates me right now to see how hurt and something that she was looking so forward for all my fears about to sting instead of them that means simply going outside and and after the food shop to my children and catching it and bring it home for today man it's just it's a it's a cool cool thing that's happening right now my hopes is that this thing will be over really soon and Life to go back to as it is you know cuz the kids playing outside and homeschool just almost to a real normal you know I know it's not going to go right away to the to the way it used to be but sometime in the near future child just said it will then and we can go on with our lives what's been helping me get through this crisis is spin out I am incredibly critically thankful that you know me and my children are we were close but we can't even close so what doing things that we didn't do you know before this crisis or actually we're doing things more often now than we did when we was in this crisis I mean from my myself and my own for children that live with me we would have won some money movie night at we would sit and watch a movie together but this is happening more often which is bringing us closed so we're playing games with talkin you know it's it's it's it's really show me a lot you know not to take that showed me not to take ratchet don't take life for granted and don't take the outside for granted and don't take. Don't take anything for granted and calling people don't take it you know be thankful tell your loved ones you love them you know even don't let some more problems turn into you smart I think that's about it you know thank you for letting me record this message for you guys
465,"This time has been full of ups and downs.  Parents and children alike are disrupted from any sense of normalcy, distanced from loved ones and in our case, even in a new home away from NYC.  While we are past the initial overwhelming changes, days are still full of more questions than answers: when will we be asked to go back to the office, will it be safe, will I have child care, what will I do with my kids this summer, how will they react with what changes are coming.  It requires a degree of mental resilience and flexibility that most people don’t have.  So as time progresses and we do our best to live a new normal, feelings of being overwhelmed creep in often for kids and parents and materialize in various ways - frustration over division of labor in the home and how to manage it all plus homeschooling, tech problems, lack of exercise and fresh air, shorter fuses etc.  it’s a just a bit hard.  Parts of wonderful- more time to just be with our immediate family, dinners together every night, a slower weekend pace just to name a few."
466,how are we doing with the cove at crisis well for starters we have each other my wife sue if 23 years my son Mills who says 17 going on no actually he is rebelling still but not as much as he used to and and we're fine we're we're here in New York City we we have each other we have enough food in the fridge and I still have a job which is more thanturn off 25 million Americans can say right now maybe even more than that that's just to apply for unemployment what about all those people that couldn't write that have jobs where you don't get paid on the books on so it's probably more like I don't know 30 35 40 million people right now who are wondering how to put it together so so we're fine but but there's been an emotional toll for sure a psychic Mills actually is probably doing the best of all of us he prefers going to school on his computer he prefers interacting with the world Visa be the reason to be the protection of a computer I guess because it makes me feel saferand I don't know maybe for my wife it's not that much different because some she was she's freelancing she was out of it didn't have any gigs for the last little while so so for her this is kind of maybe with the exception of having a mask up and do you know if he will be all careful when you go out or whatever and limit your time's going out I've made a huge transition I teach in a public school out in Jamaica Queens 3500 kids theater teacher all my classes are super physical right acting building sets dark as well so this is also something that's really hard to do online especially when our population struggles with them maybe having the resources to have the technology at home or the connections to the internet if they have those they're often sharing them amongst a lot of people their space compromise their food compromised you know there's there's just a lot of issues I think right now I'm having about 50 to 75% lion with regard to my online lessons I've been focusing most of mine around how do you feel about this like what you guys are doing right now with this basically I'm having my kids right about that free videos about it flipgrid that site for Education where you allow kids to make videos back and forth with each other and end for me to make videos for that like that's ever been a really pretty good thing for some of my students yeah I think a lot of my peers are struggling as well to to be relevant and to be helpful in this time and I did fulfill our mission right which is to educate these kids to a standard National Standard that's Based on data and numbers and Mastery of standardized tests which in and of itself as a whole bailiwick of problems that's not the right word as a Wrath of issues that I that I could bring up about it but you know in the end we're really just trying to do the same thing we've always done was get kids to think critically on Fit Kids to believe in themselves get kids to solve problems and get to trust their own experience as their best teacher and to prepare them to go out into the world and make their way so sorry I'm trying that but it's really hard poetry is helped me a lot I know that sounds really stupid but I wrote a poem for NPR you could check it out it's called the row row on WNYC play that are on the are a couple days ago as part of their National poetry month thing the theme was calls out what a difference a month makes I guess that's all. Thank you for doing this

467,"I have been blessed to work from home so we have gotten used to being thabkful for that. Being at home all the time has caused us to grow more fruatrated with each other, and even the house is starting to break down with the non stop occupying. 
Even theough all these challanges we have also shown a strong need to communicate in ways that never happened before. Saying thing like this is how I understood what you said is common place and it is doing wonders for the family. 
We all have a secret fear of what is going to be when thing open back up and how we will have to act but knowing now the strength we have together I hope tjat will continue even when we move outside back into the world.
Stay strong and try to look at things from the other point of view. It helps no matter what you say.
Stay healthy, be well, and for all those suffering feel inner peace and I hope you will find joy some day."
468,hi I'm supposed to be recording my fears frustrations and needs right now as well as what's been helping get through this crisis it's April 27th my grandmother died of the virus exactly a week ago from today time she was quite old and not well but not being able to be with her at the end or hold her hand could really see us so we would talk to her and hold her hands so she could find us find our voices instead she was alone in a dark room for the last month 6 weeks whatever it was really six seven weeks of her life alone in a room and then she got sick or she tested positive luckily she never got incredibly sick so there is a blessing in that she was just frail and old the weekend of a funeral luckily my children did get to very quickly going to the funeral parlor and Say Goodbye during her virtual week so they at least can kind of understand some of what was happening but it's definitely not anything you'd ever expect not to be able to like Barry the people you love no matter what how much is time in okay and you've made peace with a long beautiful life can't bury them you can't have a funeral can't go to church so I don't really know I have so many fears about my children not exercising not moving not going outside it's been raining for weeks it's freezing by New York City so cold and wet and gross it's really draining EXO many fears about their health and their activity of their brains because they're not getting activity their brains on those machines of games in the machines all day so frustrated with my spouse never ending fighting never-ending fighting I can't keep up with anything I am always kind I say I'm failing quarantine apparently I'm not supposed to say I stale quarantine how can you fail like there are no rules but it really feels like I'm doing it all worse than other people so that stinks I don't like getting F's on her report card so I don't know I have some friends so I would that I get a lot of laughter from there helping a blessing has been connecting with people who I haven't seen in years or talked to in a regular basis and now like fight we have the time and we have the motivation and it's like actually like the most fun is having Zoom calls with them and FaceTime chats so that that has been special that has been an interesting blessing and unexpected silver lining and I don't really know what else I don't know what my needs are I don't know I saw that everyday feels like a full are my little one asked the other day he said what day is it said Tuesday said Mama are there even such things as Fridays anymore and I said I don't even know if it's like I don't even know it's very young it's a very unknown time and both my two oldest kids will have their birthdays in quarantine next week they're kind of big I mean their kids but they're still bigger Milestone birthdays and it stinks really stinks and I have fear that no one will come up for their show up for their car parade and no one will care and they don't like they have they don't have very strong friend bonds tonight
470,hi I'd like to share my thoughts on the coronavirus situation and my fears are that you know it's taking a toll on this family mentally especially for my 14 year old and my 16 year old that they don't have the socialization that they used to while they were in school and it's depressing on the other hand it is bringing my family closer together I hope that they find a vaccination I hope they find a cure I hope that it stops spreading and I hope that we can open up the economy as soon as possible and get back to our normal life I really want to know get out what's happening next month the fear is the unknown and how everyday we have no answers but I am hopeful and the kids are hopeful and we are healthy so that does keep me motivated exercise keeps me motivated and encouraging the children to follow a routine helps in the situation thank you
475,hi I just wanted to share a little bit about some of my thoughts and feelings as a special needs parent during this time of quarantine and the covid-19 and IMAX so my oldest son is 10 and he has ADHD and three learning disabilities and is gifted and his school is has been up and running with e-learning pretty quickly since the quarantine started and my youngest son is 5 he is on the autism spectrum and he is in preschool and they are also offering e-learning I'm as well and so it has been a challenge temperature with both of them I'm also working from home and my husband is out of work and home kind of being the person to help with our kids and their school while I'm working so that we are all working together as a family to help her kids be successful I think for me one of the biggest things that has been a challenge isour younger son for sure he doesn't really like school to begin with has never really been a fan of going and so it's already been a challenge to get him to go but at least he was going and he was able to participate and most of the activities at school now that he's been home he has no interest in learning at all and for him School happens at school and play happy and it has been very difficult to make that transition for him my husband I've really been trying pretty hard everyday to get him to watch the videos that are being sent from high school and do the activities that are being sent and he doesn't have any interest in doing them and we've tried a handful of different strategies including visual schedules and person and reinforcers and I'm just picking their activities a little bit but it's not going so well so we're now I'm kind of starting over and thinking of Plan D I thinkwhich I think is probably going to consist of not doing any school activities from his school but just trying to do some of our own novel activities that he's not done before I'm hoping maybe that will help just to kind of keep the learning going but it's definitely been a challenge she's also super fixated on certain things and there's no distracting him they're all stuck in the house and there's nowhere to go and it's just been very very challenging so my older son has been a little less challenging but still challenges there too we just don't have the ability for one of us to sit with him one-on-one all day so we're kind of relying on his own concentration power and attention he thankfully does something's better on the computer which is good but he also gets distracted really easily and it's it's just been hard so he's not getting everything done that he needs to I'm only getting some of it soI'm grateful there's a lot of really thankful for that our school is providing opportunities for learning there's just a lot of pressure on us as parents while we're also trying to work maintain a household you know it make sure we have groceries and pay the bills and there's just a lot of pressure it's really stressful it's been a huge huge transition and you know I know there's a lot of things that are kind of going I'm done in terms of learning there's a lot of things that they're not doing that I really wish they were but I also find comfort in knowing that we're not alone. There's a lot of other people out there in the same boat people with neurotypical children and people with neurodiverse children that are may be struggling a little bit more so it's just helpful to know that we are experiencing this not in isolation even though we feel like we're in isolation and I hope that we will be able to recover and their children will be able to recover this last time in the floss killbut I'm sure we would really benefit from support I really I am providing Therapy Services cuz I'm a therapist electronically and I really wish that I had someone took to be that person for us because I feel like that would be really helpful but our service providers for our children are not able to provide that quite as much special for my youngest son during this time so anyways that's my thoughts and feelings I hope this helps thanks for giving me a platform to share our at my thoughts and yeah I want to thank you child MIND Institute for everything that you've done my oldest son has participated in your study and it was just a really positive experience for us thanks for your videos that are putting out the LA and just thanks for being there so thanks everyone teacher
476,"hi I guess this is recording now I'm happy to provide a small audio and enter participate more if that would help I have a 15 year old you wonderful kid she was already in cyber school when this started so we were fortunate in that she didn't have to make a significant change to her academics but heard a program that she went to she's in a pre-professional ballet program that's where she socializes that's where she gets her energy out for her ADHD that helps regulate her her schedule is extremely important to her staying healthy and this is really thrownher for a loop her and her friends they've been really adaptive and resilient because that night they get on with one another on house-party or one of those other social media hate me also use Snapchat of course in Instagram but the kids are really having a good time because she had a strong base in the strong network of friends and then they even expand that wall they have been in quarantine but just I know it's been a struggle for her it's not the same in addition she has a bunch of physical health problems so last year she was out for almost the entire school year having surgeries and recovering and so she lost her ninth-grade year and this is her 10th grade year and it seems to her and I would feel the same that is completely unfair that two years in a row her life was taken away from her she can't participate the way she wants to it's been also tough to manage a professional ballerina who goes from training 30 hours a week hard hard hard hard with extremely demanding teachers and and and inability to do it to nothing cuz they she can work in the homes you can work on our technique she doesn't absolutely amazing job motivating herself to do those things it's not the same as in person and just the other day about 2 days ago she really communicated that she was just sad little pure sadness that she was not going to go back to school and see and not having end of the year and I think that's related just to this year I don't even know if it's compounded by last year just she was having such a great life great time and to take to go from having like the time of your life living your fullest life as they say really doing is hard work and good work and good academic work and then having it all taken away from you that that is a trauma we during these ages we want them to learn if you work hard you put your all in your for your effort in your rewarded by the outcome that's consistent with the work that you put into it and so what they're learning is that isn't true there's a disconnect between you know I was going along doing what was a developmentally expected of me above and beyond for some of them and all of a sudden it could be taken away so I think that and in terms of rebuilding for the kids and we're starting at home now is to really even work from a trauma-informed perspective, developmental psychologists and I'm just thinking what we need to do is teach them to reconnect with her sense of agency to reconnect with their sense of control to help them kind of accelerate their identity process will they have this time to look inward think of who they are so that they have that strength to take with them when they come out of this is definitely a very difficult time and I don't think that parents have the time to deal with all of this right now and unfortunately you know it's the time when teenagers need their space very healthy space and to be in the pier world so that they can develop but they're with their parents and it's not that they don't love their parents just that they need to find out who they are separate from their parents so it's a very odd time she asks in all earnestness you know please predict when I think"
477,"I have anxiety about every sneeze, scratchy throat, or stuffy nose I have. I know in reality it’s my allergies but I lay awake at night thinking “what if this is it? What if I have the virus? What if I give it to my husband and children, and my 86 year old mom?” I am frustrated that there is so much schoolwork for these kids that are already having a hard time dealing with their normal routine being so abruptly ripped away and their social nature being deprived. I understand they have to learn, I just wish their could be more enjoyment and spontaneity in it with less structure. A lot of us have unhappy homes right now trying to teach them, work from home, keep some sort of organization in our homes, and keep our own depression and anxiety at bay. I have a text group with my mom friends where we vent, A LOT. I try to exercise to keep the stress level down, and I have a wonderful spouse to talk to. I also do virtual meetings with my therapist once every couple weeks to talk, which is really helpful. We try to have fun with the kids by having family movie night, hang in the yard, have fires and roast marshmallows, ride bikes/fly kites, and go for walks. I wish we could do it more during the week but there’s too much schoolwork."
481,"I had been struggling with lots amount of stress because of all the homework and classes which we must take part of. I feel like I have no free time for myself like doing exercise, singing, painting or even to have a nice and chill talk with my family. It's sad because I know we try to live as normal as usual (as a society I mean) even with the coronavirus situation but I also feel like teachers and my school doesn't understand that WE HAVE A LIFE also.
On the other hand, I have been dealing with some changes in my eating habits, like I don't eat too much because I don't have time to exercise so I am not able to burn the food I eat.  That's why I had ate less than what I normally would have been eaten if we were in the ""reality"".
In the case of my mental health, I had felt like the days are just the same, I make the same everyday, with the same problems and no solution, the same problem with my ""new"" eating habits, it's the right amount of food what I am eating?, it's too much, too little? Is my mom going to tell me what I eat less than usual... again??
I feel like I have no power in my days now, like this situation has gain the right to control my life and I can't do anything to make things right een when I know things are bad."
484,hi my name is Jacqueline Reza and I'm here to share my thoughts so today is April 27th and you just found out that the stay-at-home is going to be extended past May 15th and as I'm recording this I can hear outside at 7 everybody cheering on our essential workers are our doctors and nurses and grocery store workers and everybody that's got to go to work and how appreciated that they are at this point in time I've settled into staying home life my life the pace of my life has slowed down considerably and I'm actually not as worried as I was in the beginning we have sound of a good routine here at home our son is taken to learning online pretty well as long as we stay on top of themit's nice having all of us at home together since prior to this we really didn't see one another all that much except that night and you know on the weekends usually I was running around food shopping and stuff so currently I'm not that worried and I think that our son is feeling a little bit better he's probably more annoyed than haven't you know having us around as much as we are so he doesn't have quite so much alone timeanyway I'll come back and record more as time goes by adjust if I had any sort of here right now it just ECR us losing my job because I work in Real Estate Management and are tenants there don't have any money coming in because their businesses are not open so that affect our bottom line so we'll see where we are in a month that's it for now
484,"What are my students thinking about this pandemic? They don't say much. They express barely anything. Maybe it's easier for them to adapt to these circumstances. Maybe they suffer a lot. I wish I knew. Can they even comprehend what is happening? What will be the long-term effect? Will this make them selfish and cold and disrespectful to elderly? Or will this create better kids, better youth and an amazingly beautiful generation?"
485,in a way it's been a little easier with Corona and there not being any school because there isn't that pressure to get my son ready in the morning to the bus when she was never able to do on the mornings were like with a challenging could not get him to complete any tasks like getting dressed and eating breakfast and you know in the amount of time that was needed time to make it to the school bus so that has been used and school wasn't so easy for him in terms of socializing so you know
485,"Schools are still closed. This has been way too long for children to be home. Nowhere in media is it talked about how this prolonged absence from being in school affect students' well being. It almost feels like a surreal experiment. I am not so worried about lesrning. More so about social skills, fidgeting combined with ability to focus, and physical health. Some learning like basic skills and reading comprehension can be taught effectively remotely."
487,"It's incredibly stressful to know that we may not know for some time how this is affecting our children.  While it's fortunate that we live in a time where they can engage with friends using technology, it's not the same."
492,hi this is Lori real the Trap and my husband trap I am we're going to share some of our fears frustrations and needs right now as well as what has been helping us get through this crisis we are doing very well probably better than most and we're very blessed here what gets us through was Rd faith in God and our ability to help our family and others we are up financially solvent I work for the Department of Ed for 33 years and I'm getting a very good tension and now I will be receiving Social Security as I am 62 and my children will also be getting Social Security my husband receive Social Security and he also works teaching music I'm a licensed mental health counselor and I also do some counseling online and I also I'm up holistic entrepreneur night pursuing that increasing my business so we have you know we're in a really good position we know a lot about how's the wellness and we apply that to our own lives with lead as healthy as possible with high vibrational products and sell patches the kids take Vitamin C everyday we make sure we make sure they get out every day in the backyard we stay balanced which means they've been going to bed very very late but we've been vaping sleeping in so they've been getting the rest of the biggest fear would probably be probably share with the unknown or that one of our extended family members get sick we have several working on the front lines the frustration is what would you say this frustration is Carl what you say you may be for me going to the store and not being able to go about as as I like to you know things aren't available but we're pretty resourceful we don't need that much that's what we know we don't need so we're okay and we're also pretty self-reliance so we're doing all right we're doing all right.

492,"Lonely, worried, disconnected"
497,hi been a little bit difficult being home and my child you know being a teenager
498,the Seahawks and feelings well my family is here my wife Sue and my son Mills who 17 and he's probably the least affected by the crisis of all of us might each public school so I'm making that transition to teaching here this way I'm trying to connect with all my high needs students out in a very crowded Public School in in Jamaica Queens a Title 1 school where everybody's broke half of my kids can't get on the internet and the other half that can are struggling to self-regulate to to modulate took to do the work that they need to do to learn but we're okay we're healthy and we're safe and we're okay I have been having like trauma in my mind is psychologically my dreams are really weird but I try not to be too dramatic about it because you know I'm alive and we're okay I did write a poem for NYC they had a poetry contest Coldwater the theme was with cold water month I mean what a difference a month makes my poem is called the row row or what a month of difference makes for pendente of dyslexics or maybe my dad goes like this I used to argue in my mind with Elliot and his muddy line about April being the cruelest month after all don't November and February call for cold consideration but this April this calling by drowning in your own blood April this viral dying alone April this false flattening April uncured and uncover this invisible droplet murderer this isolation at all cost killing a dozen eggs the nice lady at the grocery store April 6th in cracks open handed masked up month of stolen brats outside with drive-thru trucks testing Behind Bars and I've got to do that again cuz I didn't follow the text
499,"these are very nerve-racking and a present a time that have abruptly caused us to adapt to change and really take this time to spend our time with our families and do the things perhaps that we could not do due to working and Andy have to let them tend to usually have before we experience covid-19 has been some of the fears that I've had I've been guarding my children's education fearing for the chief mechanic job to extend and it has been quite difficult juggling with her home construction it and work but things gradually will and have to have to learn how to really, with our time and balance work and our children's also learning distance learning but I think some of the ways to deal with these fears are by communicating dinkleberg positive sharing your children when they're frustrated cuz it was very difficult to have a first what you started this is learning but she's come along and I think it's just a matter of patience and time that we need to have during a medical the 19 social things in my family has done and hope to cope with stressors that we're going out there to walk just making sure we wear a mask before the rules we have to be very conscientious of these times that we have to be mindful example of wearing a mask wash your hands constantly continue Norms to protect ourselves and our community specials are vulnerable and so working out your exercise of the trainee recipes cooking more with your children I have a daughter's teacher loves to cook and prepare dishes and desserts in my first grader to doesn't want to see them develop those are culinary skills and enjoy that and I've tried to even share this experience has been wonderful some of the things that we have to read it how to do a really out more fun activities in 2 starts with X Y Z with our families and their covid-19 so that's pretty much what I have to say and I just remain hopeful impatient that better things are about to happen hopefully"
503,biggest fears and worries that there's a lot of uncertainty about how we need to do this I will move out of this what will look what will normal look like after this I think that's a fair that I share for when I will have my kids and what happened to school what happened with a job that will what happened with our house and what will happen in this government I think that we have a totally in app and inadequate buffoon at the top of this and he does not has no idea what he's doing and because of that license in lost and I think that they're going to try to use this and this is a big fear of mine as a way to steal the election and try to stifle votes in and shut down voices and stillstill votes and so I think that if he keep our eyes open and make sure that we don't let this pandemic be a tool for a toy corrupt government to steal the election I think that's one of my biggest fears I think that we have to be diligent about the way that we're handling this right now known as a way to survive this was a way to prepare for other crisis in the future that wouldn't they come up we are or more prepared for what will happen cuz he will come up against the school just won't be the last time and so how we handle it now and the way that we take steps towards addressing it and handling is supporting our citizens and each other will be set a precedence for what was in the future not an important part of what happened to your so it's not just about going to beach with the governor of Florida or can't you help quickly to do get back to work can we set the steps that next time this happens to it will happen again there where she will handle more efficiency so it's not about what happens now economically or with with people jobs and with people's livelihoods and I'll tell you when this happened Who's online we have jobs that can be done from from from home we have an adequate food supply in PPE for the workers and we have all these things in place so that when it happened to do it won't it won't be a message in the Lost Society vaccine is found because I've a person when we get on the subway if there's not some type of plan in place and my back scene on sway or some type of treatment I'm going to go downtown to go to work if I go to Subway
523,"I feel like I'm drowning as a single-parent working from home. I'm not parenting the way I want while trying to juggle parenting, working, taking care of the home, and taking care of myself. I'm trying to decide if it's ethical to send my child back to childcare in my conservative state when we have people around us with compromised immune systems, but I also worry about the mental ramifications of being  isolated together. Having to choose between physical health and mental health is impossible, and I cry about it every day."
524,"Our family was just coming out of trauma from March of last year, so Covid was a continuation of crazy in our lives. My husband and I have been in counseling as a couple, and individually. We’re trying to keep our mental health at the forefront, so we can help our kids through these crazy days. It has been rough. I have a lot of anxiety on a good day, so Covid and trauma have really made things difficult. However, I’m thankful for counseling, medicine, and a community of people who know our story and are helping us through. It has been very eye-opening to learn just how many people struggle with anxiety, or how quickly we can become stuck in that emotion, when things like an epidemic come about. I’m praying we all learn to have so much more compassion for each other."
525,"My kids are doing reasonably well, but like for many of us, the effects won't be seen for some time.  They miss their friends.  Learning continues, because we're reasonably equipped to support them in this, but the lack of social interaction is incredibly stressful for them."
528,"The uncertainty is draining on us all. Will we continue to have jobs, be able to go to school, etc. When will someone we know die? It's like a constant waiting for the next shoe to drop and it's hard to be optimistic because we haven't gone through anything similar before. That said, I look for a silver lining each day -- we all DO have our health, our family, food to eat and a place to live. We are fortunate and hope our good fortune lasts."
530,play this is recording so my concerns about the coronavirus in particular or myself in my right so I'm a divorced single mother who has custody of her daughter 50% time but her father and his wife are normally we both live in Brooklyn he's Upstate so there's a lot of stress about how custody is shared and you know we're not sharing to our usual custody agreement so that has introduced a lot of stress people sort ofyou know in particular I feel like there's been some unilateral decision making about how to manage and so that in itself is introduced first and then taking care of Juliet are my daughter well she's here I feel like I can't give her the attention that she requires and deserves because I'm also working from home just left to her own devices and which is you know not horrible but she's already struggling to stay focused on school and when school is remote via the Internet and she has no one to stand over her shoulder and make sure she's engaging she doesn't and I'm worried about her academic achievement and continued development of persistent sore stick-to-itiveness I guess I'm also worried about her relationship with her peers because she can't see them in person she does do some FaceTime chats or you know plays games online with them but it's different than spending time in person and that I think what happened in fact and then ultimately I feel like this whole crisis has demonstrated the lack of commitment that American society has towards families and supporting I mean social safety nine you know so many challenges that you know I feel lucky enough to dodge many of them but it's really highlighted that for me and makes me really angry and I don't know what to do about that to it that makes it makes my patient's chart you know so it's working with Juliet it's a challenge and everything thank you
531,"As daily living of the corona virus, this arises great anxiety in the society. For me this has impacted my anxiety a lot in many different ways and the rising numbers do concern me. Please to anyone in public setting, keep your distance, ‘mask it like a boss’ and wash your hands regularly! For those (like me) who suffer from mental health issues Beyond blue is my recommendation to reach out when you need some support. I hope you are all well and safe, remember to look after your self well, practice self care strategies and be kind to the community around us. We can get this over and done with it everyone plays their part!"
533,"I am scared. I don't know what the fall will bring. My school district has put forth the choices for parents to make for their kids. I'm scared to go back to work. I'm scared about our financial stability if I don't. If I decide not to go back, I can't claim unemployment. I'm scared that if I do go back I will get sick and end up in the hospital as has happened to me before with less serious viruses. I'm worried I will unintentionally spread the virus to my family, or to the students I work with.
My students have no idea how to distance themselves. Over the last four years I've been licked, spit on, sneezed and coughed on, bit, grabbed, scratched, tackled, and the list goes on. The kids I work with are either in the SPED program or are on the radar for additional help in the classroom. Then there are the kids that need hand over hand assistance, or the kids who just need a hug or a high five. What am I supposed to do for them? I'm an adult and I am feeling the lack of physical contact with my friends. Some of the kids I've worked with desperately need hugs and cuddles.
I don't know how I will handle this fall, but I know I need to keep my family safe."
541,Stressed! My 17 year old daughter is not taking being in isolation well. Now we have been told that school will be online and that worries me because my daughter’s depression will get worse. I’m in the medical field and I have to work to survive so my daughter is home alone all day💔
543,this crisis has been difficult for everybody besides being a parent I also am a school social worker so after spending all day working with my kids school being on conferences with their parents attending meetings doing virtual counseling sessions 3:34 comes and I have to turn that off and turn on mom role because my kids my 5th grader and high school student need guidance being in the education field one of the frustrating things is that so much of the education is being done through text message or through I'm just watching the video that is nothing that can replace that interaction between the teacher and student in our kids I feel are going to be lost I'm alsoturn to that even if we don't go back this year and September rolls around once we're back in school setting and Society opened up again I'm concerned looking at history with other pandemics there's going to be another wave and we're going to be closed down again and what's going to happen to the children who lived during this. Of time and their education and their development I I feel they're just going to be so far behind with it so in many ways I I think they're going to suffer educationally I think emotionally I can't even imagine the amount of Crisis counseling when I get back to work how much PTSD we're going to start seeing so it's a scary time and none of us are quite sure how this is going to turn out once things return to normal or what that normal going to look like
544,"My child revealed at bedtime last night that he feels his life isn't going very well. He said this is because he feels very lonely and was tearful. He mentioned this a few months back but it has voiced this again. He is an only child. He has cousins nearby, one his age, but are limiting social interactions. He does talk with cousin over the phone while they play video games from time to time.

Also facing the challenge that my parent,has relapsed cancer. The new treatment has hard side effects."
545,during the shutdown and before the shutdown there's been a lot of you know hectic culture shock type feeling one of the biggest fears I feel in the community and was in my sausage job and stability right now I'm really lucky to be working from home until June 30th after that my department is closing so I don't really know what I'm going to be doing after that so that is a little scary because I've been trying to move out and gained some Financial Independence I live with my mother and and it worked out for us but we definitely need some time to ourselvesI'm some frustrations are frustrations are that you know sometimes staying at home with family is a blessing and it sometimes can also be a difficult everybody go stir-crazy after you know a few days let alone a month and this might last for more than three months or so so they're just some concerns and basically the life is on holes and usually a lot so you know there's some ups and downs but at the same time the kids really are missing being social and they're worried that they won't be able to see their friends or even go to camp this summer and do all of those things but they look forward to I am trying to do a lot of activities with the kids to keep us positive playing with the Pats and going out in the yard and taking walks I will have mass smile so that makes it feel a little safer when we do take the walks and you know trying to basically organize my life because I haven't had too much time for that my room is a lot more livable now has been for the last few years because I've been so busy with college and then work so there's some in there sometimes and I hope that everything ends up okay

552,It's been most challenging these days trying to put everything online and also to try and engage students in different ways. It's hard as we can't see them F2F.
554,so let's see what's going on with my family during the coronavirus crisis I will say that I was started getting prepared very early as soon as I heard that this was starting to break out in Italy and you know I was really worried that was my United States so before the last week of February I made Costco runs at Wegmans multiple times got toilet paper and disinfectant and all kinds of things like that to try to really be prepared for a crisis and then basically by the 14th of March II was just like you know what we're leaving the city it was interesting because it's literally that. Is the week then that my office shut down my daughter's school closed and we came to Pennsylvania to stay with family and we've been here now for about 5 weeks I guess if you're crazy like we left the city and live somewhere totally different is kind of how it feels thankfully my in-laws in Pennsylvania have a separate carriage house that we can stay in and you know it's a little bit like glamping it's not fully you know our home but it doesn't have a working stove but bathrooms in microwave and so it's been fine and it's been great to honestly have space to let our daughter run around in and to havetwo extra people in the mix for us to share the responsibility of our two kids cuz we have a six month old and a seven year old so that's been really really helpful you know sharing meals and and just responsibilities my husband is doing distance learning for our daughter all day as well as taking care of my son you've lost all of his work which is really challenging but at least that's allowing him the time to be able to take care of the kids and while I'm working remotely like 9 hours solid today and it's kind of intense but it has at least I feel very very grateful that I have a job and that we have health insurance and that we can be away from the city and just you know kind of get fresh air if we need it outside although I'm literally locked inside kind of all day feels like and I haven't been able to like see my family more we actually have started talking my family that lives far away we've been doing Facebook chats and things like that which is really great and I don't know in some ways are a lot of positives of them out of it I hope that you know everybody starts to really think about the importance of Health Care and food security and all of that for people across the nation cuz it's so important yeah alright thanks
558,"These times have been so hard for so many reasons, but the forced closeness has been very challenging. It magnifies every problem, as the avenues of escape are very few, and even when they exist, with a kid around, taking a break just shifts the burden to the other parent. It's all zero-sum and brutal."
559,"We've been lucky. My wife and I are both still working at the same amount and pay as before, and our son has adapted really well to online learning. The pandemic hasn't directly impacted the health of our extended family, but it has made things much more difficult for our elderly (grand)parents. Their social outlets have disappeared, their doctors are much less eager to see them in person, home health aides are difficult to find and difficult to trust. Our family has gotten along with each other remarkably well being stuck in such close proximity and relative isolation for so long, but we miss seeing other people. We miss just going outside and playing in the park without masks and without setting ground rules for proximity with other families."
560,"As a parent to a very aware advanced 6 1/2 year old it's been really hard trying to do the balancing act of shielding him from the television or any news of the sheer number of deaths. 
Its very hard on him not being able to see his friends and be social but he does have an understanding that us staying home is for our wellbeing and safety. We pray when we need strength and to be lifted up. We play and enjoy each other's company as much as possible and actually have found alot of fun in our new found time exclusively together. I bake a lot and he loves to help, especially the tasting part! We play board games, create art, tell jokes and have epic movie nights complete with all the goodies and snacks! So all in all we feel very blessed to be in the few minority that has the means to actually stay 100% home right now during these trying times. When being stuck at home begins to weigh on us we just remember how truly lucky we are to have everything we need and want right now especially the gift of us all being together as a family safe at home.
We are making memories and getting through this together.
We do miss everything we used to do but also have learned to adapt to this new normal by understanding that this too shall pass."
564,hi there I'm not sure if I guess this is recording and the last I will say all began for myself and for my daughter we've been able to stay focused on following what is activist that means continuing to be safe following the the rules that are set before us and other words I would say things that we already were doing before this whole syndemics took place however it's just more intense and something not to take lightly make sure we follow the laws of wearing a mask especially when I'm on the train the buses you know stores my daughter doesn't really too much go out much because of her past history in terms of medically however we are busy regardless she has to therapy next happening virtually speech therapy that's happening virtually her counseling therapies happening remotely so you know we have not allowed for this unforeseen occurrence to slow us down in our lives life still must go on regardless of the situation it is sad to hear it's one thing to be ill for weeks but it's another thing to lose a life and that is the most hurtful part about it any of this stuff this is the loudest s and I believe they are humans that becoming so desensitized by death that it becomes just the norm and I wouldn't say all but it makes me wonder you know what are in people's minds and hearts 2 here's the amount of loss one's family friends strangers you and I've never even met within an hour and I'll circle with hearing about it you know and it's also a choice at the end of the day if you want to go and get checked even if you're not experiencing any symptoms I'm sure there are thousands of people who could have contemplated on doing that but they're like what if comes to mind what is EULA return back home to my loved ones what is will I have to stay in the parameters of ones that are experiencing what I'm spending some so there are many who are refusing you know when you're being told you can have it but no symptoms who wants to find out so I thought about going to go get that done you know for myself it does in the way you know he hasn't a little affected us. Evening to see the lights are not actually stopped but the things that we love to do but then there's a flip side to it you know it gives you more time to rest to do things that you weren't able to do before to reflect you know there's some good out of this unfortunately we can't forget about the pad but you make use of your time wisely and look around you but let me look around you are there any kind of questions on your head some people blaming God I have nothing to do with this not on this level is not responsible for the deaths no but anyway
567,"I think my biggest fears and frustrations through this time. Are just knowing that my child already is behind in school and also socially and this. Of not having you know her in school and also a limited social interactions I think will greatly affect her and then upcoming months it's also been somewhat stressful on myself because I feel like the school has put a lot of extra burden on us to do a lot of what I felt like they're responsible before and I don't feel like I'm really adequate to be able to homeschool my daughter or teach her the way that she probably is at school, I don't know their methodology so it's a little bit confusing and it does cause not only frustration with me but frustration with ustogether and I think you know also just for the both of us just not knowing when things are going to end or when they're going to be over it's difficult to know or just say when will go back to some of the things that we like to do what we want to do or when we'll take a vacation or when we'll be able to go to a store and buy new clothes or just do things that we like to do in that we enjoy as well as visiting family you know we had some family events that I'd be canceled because of this and not knowing exactly when we'll get back to that point to as well and then when we do also what it's going to be like because it's going to be differentso I think those are her major concerns also I think physical activity is been somewhat limiting cuz generally in the spring we start baseball or other sports programs and those of all been curtailed this year so yeah there's been a lot of frustrations and anxieties and you know we've we've had our moments definitely at home I'm too just interaction where your frustration levels can get kind of high but then on the flip side to I'm also like very happy that we had this time somewhat because it has brought us somewhat closer together I'm kind of cognizant of the fact that this time we'll end at some given point and then I wish that I have done something war of Wednesday or the other and will probably beat myself up about the fact that I probably didn't do as much as I wanted to buthoping to at least take advantage of the time that we have now that is extended that we don't normally get to enjoy time together as well so that's really about it"
571,issue is fear is so much fear you don't know what to expect more fear I'll be live in New York City which is like that the whole United States has been affected the whole world of courts in the United States has the most deaths but specifically New York City see so many deaths are men we know several people have died credibly scary I work from home mostly but I have to go to the office several times a week and I stay for a few hours and I'll come back and I'm basically living with my mom during the week so she could help me while I try to work from home because I have a toddler and my oldest and eldest is the oldest of the one was on the Spectrum so it's been a complete change of routine we don't go outside I'm the only one that goes outside basically there you used to go to the park zoo zoos and museums Children's Museums samsara Villages homes and stuff like that we're doing none of that none of that and I worry that my oldest getting used to it like I said I'm worried for her mental health and her behavior which was already bad right before schools closed it was already terrible and I was going to seek more help for that she's going to get re-evaluated and all of that was put on the backburner there were talks about sending her maybe to a different school and looking into that school that will that will know how to harness your creativity but I don't know everything is just up in the air I'm very grateful I am still working I have a source of income very grateful no one in my immediate family has gotten sick I'm grateful for the extra time with my family but I'm scared for the future because we don't know what to expect if this comes back harder in the fall in the second wave what does this mean for Life next year if we have a vaccine I asked for the same things that I don't I don't know by the vaccines see if she's there not testing them like they do most of the other vaccines which I'm okay with vaccines are there the government to some around is just like fast-tracking it right because they want the economy to be stimulated so is this just all the stuff to worry about I've never been so grateful to be alive but also so uncertain about the future Square I just hope for the best but I believe a social Society like all of us because it's the most challenging time and I don't know what to expect that's all I got
572,I'll just click on it it's a pretty obvious big button you can't miss it and I think the biggest problem before his people didn't know that they were actually recording so this just makes it abundantly clear
573,I think being home this last month-and-a-half has kind of been a good thing in a way for our family just due to the fact that we're always rushing around between school work practices and there's never enough hours in a day so this is giving us a lot of good family quality time together we're eating dinner together every night we're more in tune to each other we're we're here for each other and it's just good family bonding time that I feel like with the hustle and bustle of normal life we we tend to lose track of these things even though I try to keep it on as much of a routine as possible before this all happened it's just better this way I feel like as far as us just with a spending time I don't have to worry about rushing them from processes to practice to meet art lessons to all that stuff so I think it's great it is a little scary that we're all experiencing Mis but at the end of the day we all have to do what's right and I keep saying thank goodness that we have our health and I just hope that it stays that way
575,hello I am filling out the survey I think my daughter has suggested okay to all the restrictions because of covid-19 but I feel that she misses her friends and is looking to screen time to compensate for the fact that she cannot see them in person it's a very difficult for a 15 year old not to have in face time or in-person time with their peers and she's unfortunately using screen time with friends playing video games creating a stories and chatting rather than doing homework because she misses them so much so I would say that is our biggest concern
584,well this crisis I don't feel like specially I don't have a especially any fears and frustrations sounds perfectly fine with being homeschooled can be stressful sometimes but overall it's mostly just like school it's not the teachers in there for though I do know that other people are having some trouble which isn't exactly good and they probably would need some help so it would be great if somebody to try to help them but nobody is Ever After High School now Haitian now home barely anything about life so yeah where might a frustration though all I can say that well sometimes in the war can take while and but yeah that it's mostly yeah it's like school like this you can get extracted or you can just take a while and work is different than usual instead of going to instead of going to a class we watched video for for information and we get to know what we're supposed to do and then we write it down on the Google Docs what I really hope that we get through this and hopefully the virus doesn't get too dangerous that starts affecting too many people we are already hasn't affected the younger too much but has affected the oldest a respiratory diseases especially dangerous but it is getting a bit more dangerous I just hope it doesn't bye
607,hello I am the mother of a 16 year olds and I would boy and I would like to share his experience during covid-19 so my son is he he's an introvert so he doesn't he's not very good at reaching out to people but he does really enjoy the social interaction that he gets at school so he the school closure has really been hard for him because that was really his only social outlet he would go to school he would see you know his friends and they would have that camaraderie and you know that he would come home and do his homework and you know just going to crawl back into his shell so not having that routine of school going to school and seeing his friends he's not very good at reaching out to them proactively for example texting them or God forbid FaceTiming them like that so he really has been a recluse since schools closed and yeah and I think that this is definitely having some mental health impacts you know he's feeling lonely isolated he's not one that really shares his feelings but I can just kind of tell from his body language is demeanor that is really not enjoying this and as a result of covid-19 he's on the screen I mean I don't know 14 hours a day doing homework lots of distractions of YouTube video games so basically he gets a bee gets on the screen and then he gets off the screen then goes to that that's his life so it's been pretty pretty hard for a teenager as adults I feel like we can self-regulate and see you know like for us all to go out get exercise etc etc but for him you know he's kind of been in this just the screen Zone and with no social contact so anyway that was my feedback that I wanted to share with you thank you
608,hello I'm the mother of a 16 year old boy and I would like to share my his experience during covid-19 my son is very socially motivated he loves going to school to see his friends and this is really the highlight of his life however he's not good at being proactive and reaching out to his friends so for instance since schools have shut down he has basically you know not really reached out to any of his friends and feeling very lonely and so he misses school a lot was really crushed when the mayor you know announced that schools will be closed for the rest of the Academic Year I really really disappointed because he really look forward to going and seeing his friends at school everyday he's spending I don't know what 12 to 14 hours a day in front of the screen and yeahthis is really sort of a depressing. In his life right now because he he needs that social interaction that is not good about reaching out about being proactive and and this just basically on the screen all day and yeah I think I don't think it's good for his mental health so you know just kind of wanted to share that I think anything that schools can do to kind of encourage or mandate more face-to-face interaction be assumed whatever is is would be good for for a teenage kids who crave that interaction but might not be so good about about reaching out to their friends thank you
609,Okay so the first & main concern that we have at the moment is at our normal life Bona be back to normal on September we know this end of the year is pretty much and decided for but next year something that's we we have tons of concern regarding it that we have a daughter going to middle school next year and if something's not going to start as these or any more learning starting new school it's something that we talk a lot that's home and we discuss what we think's going to happen and then what song says strange and weird and we also have our son that these actually on a process indeed healthy brain Network and actually homeschooling now we see a lot of Austin effort and issues that we hear from from school and we handling it day-by-day and nice it's not something that is easy and bring a lot of more frustration into the family things that we handled only half of the day and the time is becoming a daily thing for us and unless the necklace for our concern is the fact that we need to talk a lot of our task and we both me and my husband and we have two kids and it says that the work life balance is disrupted for a working from home and what does help us so oldest and situation at the moment is basically being together it's something that we see makes us stronger we are all of us together for better for worse all the time and will stop most of the time we don't say go out and spend time out so it's definitely an assembly Builder
610,hello I am the mother of a 16 year old boy and I would like to share his experience of going through covid-19 my son really looks forward to going to school for the social aspect of school so he really enjoys seeing his friends and you know all the camaraderie that occurs he is however not very good at proactively reaching out to his friends and as a result has failed you know hasn't really done a good job of reaching out to them during this period of school closures and as a result he's feeling isolated only think a little bit depressed and you know his pee feels like his life is just like wake up sit in front of the screen Work Work Work video games and then go back to sleep so he's spending like I don't know 12 to 14 hours in front of the screen and was very little social contact andso it's definitely been hard for him so yeah I think mental health is you know definitely not as good as as it was and so I think that's a big side effect of the school closures is just these young people just being home being in front of the screen for such long periods and just not having that some healthy social exchange that the school environment you know gives them thank you
611,what has been helping me through this is knowing that we're spending more time together as a family instead of having to run back and forth between schools for CCD doctor's appointments and all that we're spending more time with the family we are learning to be more tolerable of each other were learning how to do things together how to get along and just the value of what family is would probably have gone to the Wayside over the last few years for many families at home so I find is very good for us and it's very helpful
615,I need the biggest struggle for me as a parent during this pandemic is raising two emerging adults right now helping them launched into the world and seen that they are both very concerned about what the future holds for them what the economy's going to look like whether or not they'll be able to find employment and then you know beyond a Basics just whether or not they'll be able to have a life where they can you know by a Holman and put down roots and feel secure in a time when everything seems to be it's also hard as a parent to raise a child with anxiety and to model the behavior when you yourself are feeling anxious and concerned in the worldit's just difficult and then to have a government that doesn't doesn't model good behavior doesn't does a show resiliency doesn't make us feel like this is all going to be okay it's really just a massive sort of title mess but then you also look around and you see these amazing people working on the front lines giving their all for the good of mankind and maybe the Hope through all of this is that we can come out on the other side of this with a Kinder and more open another and a willingness to do what's best for the whole versus just pursuing sort of individual individual goals may be the focus will you know stop this play car culture of consumerism in and turn us into people who really care about Society I know it's just a difficult time I worry a lot about my kids and I want them to be hopeful for the future but it's pretty difficult right now to see to see what they have us with so much is unknown
616,some of the advantages to come from the coronavirus and then napping any school
618,I think that my biggest frustrations to the rink covid-19 is the fact that the social emotional aspect is being taken out of the every day work please
624,I think the coronavirus pandemic has been really difficult for parents for me in particular I'm a single mother shares custody of her daughter 50/50 with my daughters a father and I really were both you live in the same time that he has gone to his serve a vacation home in the country and he's gone there and so the custody Arrangement is all different there's been some stress and then quit them working from home during this time so that were my daughter is with me I'm not able to give her the attention that books she deserves and that I think that she needs to stay focused working on you no school day there's a remote schooling and she has that little laptop and all that so I can do it but if I'm not checking in regularly yeah you start requiring her to to engage you know she makes it hard for me to accomplish my task anxiety and stress and frustration with the whole you know I mean this is the world Brian but it's difficult and that we haven't better than many many people and another thing that actually angers me that has nothing to do with my immediate situation was just the lack of the lack of is social safety net support for 4 in the individuals and families in the United States another linkage between health insurance and employment or the lack of certain Universal income or. You know severe economic downturn or whatever you know this is this dog really problematic and makes me really angry so that also started my fingers a little bit when I'm where is my daughter cuz she is also like a very strong personality and requires you know The Preserve it already you know the way things are going personally and then the way things are going through it makes it really hard but yeah cuz I have I think that's everything
625,I'm a mother of and 13 of a 13 year old son who is in 8th grade and graduating due to this pandemic that has taken over the world and immediately in our area she's unable to participate in his graduation his prom living with Milestones that he worked hard for throughout the school year to achieve what he deserves he deserves his graduation to be with supposed to be sorry I'm getting a little emotional senior trip where they were taking them to the Poconos are you deserve his you know days in school where they do every single thing here did not do any work on those days but they're doing things for their yearbook they doing you know their autographs where you know this students and principal and teachers and consign their yearbooks in sign their autograph book for them to take pictures you know what so I feel bad for my son funeral cars in that area because is nothing that we can help with nothing that we can change the make these things actually happen but you know I try to let him know that you know he will be okay at least we're healthy and leave here healthy you know and then hopefully when this is over maybe sometimes even if it's not on the date maybe they can do something when they can celebrate teeth study for test the nervous for him and the stupid through it things of that sort so that's basically as a parent Wicked you know and things of that sort but the daily activities that they will be able to do and chairman after school the way they do with the possible you no King but they have you know that's not being every time you look forward to seeing his friends he's not you know a little boy was my big boy now that makes friends easily kind of thing. So when he does have friends he's excited excited to see them play something with them and that's about it thank you
629,so high it's been quite difficult to be home with teenage child misses her friends and going outside and I'm working from home from home luckily we still have our jobs not really having issues playing paying bills which very blessed but it's been difficult to not see family or friends at least my kids can FaceTime with her friends and contact with them but it's not the same when you don't get to see the kids introvert a little a little fatter try to keep her active I got to go outside to walk the dog and do things like that keep her active in the house but if there's only so much you can do with teenagers teenagers are very different than having like four year old running around a teenager like that closeness with their friends you know even if Dad joking around and doing absolutely on the way home from school and then think knowing that the summer also and program even harder still thought of it but hopefully it won't take a toll of my child mentally cuz that is I think it's on myself and watching her go through certain changes we'll see how things go and hopefully in the future you know we can get out of this with nobody being sick and you know so far we've been lucky and black hopefully this will be over real soon thank you and I hope everyone stay safe and healthy
633,this has been very very hard for our family because my husband and I both have been working through this crisis my husband and I are both school teacher I'm teaching Zoom online live throughout the day in my husband's doing the same he's doing his vehicle Google Classroom our time is very very sensitive for daughters are twins at 6 years old and my daughter Jessica is having a really really really tough time not seeing my friends is it it's hard because she's sick and they give you homework which is on a tablet a computer of course we didn't have enough computers for everybody to be doing their work me working from home and working from home and get your kids to do their homework they need their homework to hand over hand because they don't know how to feed I mean it's just this whole thing is just been very very very frustrating for our family onare seeking psychiatric help out ourselves to help us cope to help me COPE in actuality cuz it's just been very very challenging to watch both online and be a parent and me and Mom Uber for my parents said you know what everybody need toilet paper and hand soap liquid hand soap I can't I can't seem to be able to find liquid answer three months and our daughters are saying our anxiety as what has been going on I'm trying to go to the food store isn't there a little bit fearful because they actually saw as physically put on everything and there's a lot of questions in around its mass every single day am I going to get the virus has sneezed is that the virus you know I'm good call oh my God I didn't like that the virus so is it is been trying to explain a lot of these little questions that you know that your daughter still need to know but they're very very careful of of getting it or knowing someone that's gotten it and I wonder could it be us is it us so what is helping us getting through the crisis is just a sense of family and unity one thing good about this is that I'm I am not commuting to and from New York City are you get a chance to actually have three meals a day with my family they spent much time together we get outside at least twice a day as a family and you know we love each other dearly and that's what really helps and we keep a strict schedule because kids need continuity kids need to know what's going on in Rolling online that's what it is
634,I grew up in Michigan so I was raised to prepare for storm situations where that may lead us stuck inside for days because of power or ice snow even living in the middle of climate of milder climate in New Jersey for the last 12 years I'll still like Jiffy Pop TriCity and muffin mix without milk and eggs dairy just part of my standard getting ready for winter routine this is different though things I'm used to being prepared for it wasn't even the prepare for homeschooling because we can clear up old laptops and purchased a powerful routerit left me unprepared mentally I was not prepared to stay up all night because I have nightmares about my children dying in the hospital alone because I'm not allowed to be with them and I was not prepared to search for food delivery for my parents so they don't go out at their house to go shopping I was not prepared to that have a way to escape constantly being with my immediate family and can't go to work you can't you don't leave the house I can't take them to the ice cream shop I I wasn't prepared to not have a job. Had not had a job since I was 15 but it's not just lost my job I haven't heard from my co-workers for 3 and 1/2 Weeks nobody's they haven't called to see how I am and the deal with all these what apps you know my husband's company is talking about what if we have to cut everyone salaries and you know when they were talkin 20% it was okay but they're throwing around the idea of 50% salary Cuts I mean that's pretty freaking scary I wasn't prepared to handle the Panic inside like when you go grocery shopping and I went through three aisles in the store that had nothing in them like I couldn't even forgot to remember what that I owe used to be I passed the baking aisle three times before I realized that was the baking aisle where flour and sugar and stuff like that should be all right I was a prepared for that you know my mom's generation specifically kids that were my mom's age so kindergarten through second grade when the the polio big the whole generation they weren't allowed to go swimming because the parents were afraid that if they swear they would catch polio easier so they weren't allowed to go swimming so they never learn how to swim and my mom caught polio anyway so my grandparents Terre Haute savings making her better and her personality changed she was no longer the leader of the kid talking to my uncle became the leader you know it's they they say that the polio cost her a definite personality change so I think that's my biggest overall worried besides its immediate is what what is going to be the long-term change in my kid's life because of this event right now to hear they can't play ball they can't go they can't join their sports leagues they can't go swimming then they might not be able to go to camp that can't go to school I don't know how this is going to have a long-term effect on them or not I don't know yet and I suppose that scary

657,it's been about five weeks since the side he has been shut down and we've been forced to be home because of this pandemic there are so many people that are out of work or struggling to make ends meet financially because of again this pandemic I'm lucky to be in a job where I'm still working even if it is from home which brings its own host of issues problems new stressors in many ways I think it's more stressful than working in a school social worker so I spend all day on meetings with parents reaching out and do counseling sessions with kids just doing basic case management staff andit it's taking me so much longer to get through that then if I was in actually in work so after putting in more than my regularly scheduled school day I then turn it off and need to go back to being a parent and as a parent my kids are getting video lessons and educated online but then there are also left to their own devices for much of it so when I turn off my school day I start their school day so my evenings are now a friend doing we're redoing work with a 5th grader and a high school student and it just really makes me concerned what's going to happen to those students whose parents don't have the ability to help them where are working on our front lines and coming home exhausted and just can't do this stuffwhen Society opens again it's it's nobody quite knows what the new normal is there such a word as going to be how much of our Lives will go back to being the same how much is going to be changed how much PTSD are we going to see in our kids in our grown-ups especially in our health care workers who were on the front lines so no one really knows where does pandemic is going to lead us and what's going to happen
658,advantages has been that the mornings are always a very big struggle getting my son to be ready for school on time was exceptionally difficult for him was very hard for him to do whatever you need to do in the morning like it just took hours getting ready for school and by the time either missed the school bus or by the time he made it was very tense and so that challenge has been issued now except for that he's never ready I mean he stoled witness but at least you don't have the pressure of having to make it to the school bus and then in terms of like socializing that was a very challenging for having school so although he missesbeing in school and seeing friends cuz none of that life daily fighting and you're not having to struggle social skills and that situation so in a way it's been a lot less stressful for my son so that's been good but other challenges aren't that is just so bored you know 9 year old boy all day is not easy so
669,so I thought I would speak also as a parent I have one son and University who had to come home to The Cove in so his university wasn't for that much longer so he accused in Computing science so it was sort of a natural I think shift but he's he found it quite hard to learn such a technical stuff without a teacher right there and without the classmates and he did it but I think it took a little extra effort and right now he's done all his exams so I'm very proud of him she finished it Choice one more year so I'm not sure what next year will look like and it's kind of disappointing kind of a no closure ending in a way to it just sort of ended and then come home and get all this stuff and stressful but doable and not that big a deal depends on if it goes all next year I think that would be a whole other thing that will have to deal with then I have two other kids in school one is in high school grade 11 she kind of has special needs and it's been we were at the point honestly of pulling her out and doing online school anyways to be honest it kind of worked out in her favor but then we realized we have sit with her and actually make sure she does everything and like yeah my husband is actually better at that than I am and I feel like I burned out just trying to get her to go to school for so many years but you know hopefully this is the way that she can learn and even if it goes next year it would be nice if she had a grad next year at the end and she misses her friends a little bit but she didn't really have that many friends so anyway it's okay my son who is in Grade 9 he's also quite an introvert and she was developing a sensitivity to lots of chewing sounds and stuff and he was getting a lot of anxiety in a wave by being at school a lot of annoyance with his classmates cuz he's been with them for a long time it's a small school so honestly for him he's loving it he loves his free time he hangs out with his big brother who is home from college and so far honestly it seems not bad for my point of view he's doing great he's self-motivated he's doing it he's doing well he was an a student I think he likes the efficiency of it and he's hoping to go to a big high school next year so that could be a bigger let down I think if you can't do that but we'll get there when we get there and yeah I think for me it's sad that there's no graduation from Grade 9 that's my last child so that's a little bit of a lack of closure again but she's happy so I'm happy as well so that it's not been that bad my husband's also check he kind of guy so he was able to fix up our internet to be better and we had to do a lot of rearranging around the house to make sure everyone had a good space and that they weren't beside someone who is annoying them and I didn't want any computers in their bedroom so we managed. But it took a bit of effort was a little stressful and we have to do it all pretty quickly and you can't really go shopping and so that was a bit of a challenge and I'm having a hard time actually getting them to do exercise or you know get up on time I've had to be really flexible and let them work in their pajamas and just let them like figure it out and I think it's been realistic expectations on them now so it's an adjustment. So I've been pretty gracious I think and it's going okay
670,I'm concerned about the health and safety of my family and I'm also concerned about the lack of Education that's available to my children now I'm worried about what's going to happen to them next year are we going to make up for this time socially academically and emotionally
674,we're getting through it I guess we'll see the love of our family members as Rite Aid in yet that's was easy because I have people to talk to and if I'm stressing Nia Peeples you know basically calm my nerves but other than that it's a stressful time it's a hard thing to go through but I think I finally we're all welcome NASA live New York we've been through more worse things than this so I'm pretty sure we'll get through it.
675,we don't realize how things affect us in different ways especially our children a lot of times they just don't understand what's going on and a time like this it's extremely confusing to them and it's hard for them to understand but we're definitely getting through this together as frustrating as it is this crisis has been extremely scary and you know the needs of our children and stuff is very important so we continue to learn and grow and only hope things get better
676,this time has been very frustrating for myself and my family but what has helped us is family really being able to laugh together and cry together and be creative looking at different recipes and cooking what has been very frustrating inside is telling my aunt that I don't know when he'll return to soccer practice to the the group and his team that he loves very much and has been playing since he was three years old but I hope and pray that this will pass rather quickly
677,I am worried that my boss is might compel me to work and I Haven of covet
683,"I just wanted to emphasize how New York New Jersey and rims a coronavirus crisis It's upsetting that the potential for medication hydroxychloroquine is not available and Dexter can already prescribed Pharmacy Lord delivers this medicine they haven't done that is helping him out patient outpatient settings so they don't let the patients to recover Vans are just beginning to be Sikh Isaiah keeping this medicine on like when people is in the hospital and two very very sick when it's really not help him sleep with parents that don't have the knobs protective equipment that don't have an a ventilator some it's not a job it's just a job and they just areeven if New York collection I think the most taxes in the country they're like state car tax and see to talk some level of two businesses, surprisingly bad as that same battle how good so I can manage and people are diadem's and just do nothing just talk and so this is my Frost and ice and I'm frustrated about schools that are not open as are like my kids at home and it's like Zoom is like whatever I digital is not very good and hopefully we'll talk over the times of Crisis thank you"

687,this crisis has affected my family because I am an ER nurse my husband is a detective with the Emergency Services Unit in the NYPD my older son has ADD as well as autism and my younger son's drives in a classroom setting and not in a home setting so I am still going to work witnessing the virus ravaged healthy populations as well as sick populations regardless of age gender or race we do not understand everything about it everyday we're learning something different about it sometimes that conflicted something we've learned about it before he was vice prostrating I am not provided with enough protective equipment at work to perform my duties properly luckily I was able to get my own but that should not have been necessary my Hospital Administration has not been communicating with the staff or depress our Union is not very helpful Staten Island has not gotten a lot of help from all of the medical staff coming from other states and God bless them but our government or our hospital is in sending them to us my husband is also pretty in paramedic and he you know is he's not expose as much as me but he still is getting exposed and we have a nine year old and 6 year old at home with them have asthma so it's a constant concern I can't kiss my boys good night and they want to and I told them off when I call them hug them because I can't have them to close to me my older son is missing his fourth one specialized classroom is missing his speech therapy he's missing his occupational therapy he's missing his terros health in the class struggling to learn what the teachers are posting online my younger son usually has homework done in 20 to 25 minutes and yet he can't do any of the school work as quick as that and he keeps on telling me that it's because he misses school he misses his classroom and what can I do about that so they're struggling with my husband and I had to switch our shift around because we can't have anybody babysit so it's been kind of a lot on our family and and my husband and I are dealing with it okay but it's still frustrating I have friends who own their own chiropractic office and they're making a 1/4 of what they usually make this was after insurance had cut their rights to begin so now it's just getting worse I haven't been able to see hug kiss my mom she's had to put down her dog of 13 years and I can't go over there and help her and be with her as I want to my in-laws are in Florida and they can't come back until this hard on everyone and I pray that it is over soon
693,hello the coronavirus has been okay at our house I find that my son is more connected to us he feels more loved he is more helpful around the house doing chores and stuff because we're doing them together we're doing more family stuff together or cooking together as a family were watching movies together or playing games or taking walks with the dog and I think that's helping him work to his trauma more of course it's difficult and more time-consuming for me because I I have to still work on top of helping him with his school work but overall there was a bump in the first week and a half or so first couple of weeks where it was a little difficult until we got the hang of everything but once we got the hang of everything it's been it's been really nice actually we were kind of homebodies anyway so things haven't changed too much we aren't able to go camping in our camper since everything is closed and he hasn't been able to do drum lessons and the dance and drama classes that he was taking but other than that nothing has really changed all that much and in fact it's been mostly a positive
694,I think that was frustrating me the most during covid-19 is the fact that no one is really taking the social emotional component inside practice that we're not looking at what students need in order to get by tunde several times as a teacher myself I'm unable to help my children serving their school day because I have to be a teacher there's no flexibility in what can be done doing today everything is expected to be completed in real time and it's very frustrating because I'm neglecting my own children in order to satisfy the requirements of my job is causing a lot of anxiety not only of myself on my children and within my householdI think I know one is paying attention to the fact that it's not that we can complete these tasks is that we never needed to complete them all at the same time and that expectation you know that because you're home you're able to do is simply unrealistic unfeasible from many
695,I think that one of the greatest challenges about the time they were in right now for adults and children are the effect that it has on you when you were used to being a very social person example as an adult I work in the fields I'm used to going into my account your daily interaction with people or my son you know this is the first year of middle school he was at a new school he was just getting to know you friends and really starting to kind of find his way and coronavirus has that it interrupted that you quit again and that kind of hurt and I know that in the great scheme of things I still have my job my child is healthy my parents are healthy and so I don't take that for granted because I know that they're people that are out there who have lost their jobs we're not able to provide for their families whose family members are in the hospital however what I think of the overwhelming feeling for me is sadness worried my anxiety is definitely increase and I think that children especially are going to need a lot of therapy and a lot of resources to help them deal with the effects of coronavirus and the things that have happened around it it is mentally exhausted for adults who have the tools to handle it and so I often worry with children who don't have the tools to handle it how they will affect them and it makes me sad because I think that this country really doesn't understand totally what's going on with coronavirus I feel like it is learn as they go because it's something very new that many of my doctors Inn at work have never even seen or heard of before and so that's also that they must experience the fear of the unknown and that we need to know more about that. That's how we've been affected here in my household
706,okay but the audio doesn't show you exactly when it starts recording but I believe it's recording now I just wanted to share something that was sweet my daughter is 15 and a half and she has a group of friends that she goes to school with that they do cyber school and then she also is in a pre-professional ballet program so they were friends before they had to go into quarantine and they have found a way to interact online that where they have their fun at night and I think that our is really nice that they have social media to do that and then one a few nights ago I said you know you guys can just keep playing goofing around and kind of like play fighting with one another to keep yourself busy and not bored even though you're having a fun time I just thought you know there was a recipe for disaster possibly coming and so my daughter woke up this morning and she has been like that again having fun at night and there's lots of giggles and I really think laughter is the best thing for them in terms of keeping their mental health up so then today she said this afternoon she's like I'm going to prepare for tonight cuz we're going to have a debate at 9:30 and ask what what she means and she said that you know there are nine of them like 9 or four friends are getting together to have a debate about abortion so they're there 15 and 16 year old and I think sometimes we think that they're always just doing like goofy stuff and they don't really you know like they're just on social media and they're wasting their time I was just really impressed and then she spent the day putting together her talking points and we discussed you know where she's in the bed and I was talking to her about you know the rules of debate and you know play procedure has I'm just I thought it was just such a nice sweet story that these 15 16 year olds are getting together to do something the end there and they're very excited about it and no adult was involved they decided to do it on their own so I'm looking forward to how they have how they how they experienced it and I just wanted to share that it was a nice and nice activity in a nice part of their comradery they came together because of the pain thank you
708,my son Teddy my older son struggles with anxiety and it's a hard time socially under normal circumstances until I actually think all of this he seems pretty good he really likes to be home with a lot of unstructured time he has a lot of personal resources and hobbies things you like to do is win our keys drawing and sort of hanging out it is not so hard for him to be home with his younger brother who is generally a much more social conventional kid is having a much harder time than I am very very concerned about the screens even my side even when they're doing school work even when they're doing good things on it or watching things that I think are you know perfectly appropriate on them all the time it's such a long day and it's very very very hard to control thanks
710,"my Sears I don't really have any about the quarantine will Coronavirus frustration with me online school cuz I can't pay attention hopes Randy koulisis quarantine, virus passes but what is helping me get through this crisis Tik Tok and haikyuu"
712,my fears is that dumb there many particularly because living in the epicenter of the virus here in New York City the steers are getting through the day to fears are Financial all of my revenue streams have dried up as of March 13th the fears are maintaining health and high immune function the fears are taking care of my two children as a single mom with no income in the foreseeable future is fear of walking out the door just to get the mail or throw out the trash making sure I have my gloves at my mask the frustrations simple things like getting food ordering food waiting for weeks to get an appointment for a delivery time slot social distancing measures on the street in frustration when you see a whole spectrum of people being very lacks about it or feeling kind of judged because of how your social distancing my needs I have the need for connection I have the need for financial stability I have been need for rest I'm not sleeping so great these days I have the needs of Cam I have been need of of human touch my hopes that we can transition in a way that is fluid and stable and Progressive and that we come out of this better and stronger as individuals and collectively better than ever what's helping me get through technology being in the household with my children family friends interaction and taking the time to heal and take care of the task in the home and creatively of things that I never had time to do previously
714,yeah I don't think they are going through let me try yeah yeah it says that I voted yeah I'm at 13 doesn't seem to accept it yeah sorry I put I tried to put 13 but it doesn't seem to be accepting what's the weather in mitzel tricky about estimating these is some things take a lot of time but conceptually they're very straightforward it's like just need to built this out and other things are like I'm not sure quite how we're going to fix it but it's going to be fun thinking about the problem and maybe it'll take a long time maybe it won't and then each of us may prefer a different kind of problem yeah the lack of clarity yeah yeah I think I think that makes sense I just wanted to reiterate my will the saying a few minutes ago which is if we can if we can pull off the first the super simple verse
716,let's see what is going on with the PS4 us honestly we've really had it better than many I guess we we heard that this weekend coming I have made Costco runs early and stock up on hand sanitizer and wipes and kissing and food and perishable the toilet paper so I missed all the runs because I am probably slightly improper anyway and and then as soon as it started to look like it was getting bad around like March 14th we hightailed it out of the city and are staying with family and Pennsylvania and so much for a world for us hereand that's been really positive and a lifesaver for my brain space was so our daughter can just run you know she can burn off her energy we can walk around and it's quiet I'm working full-time from home you note 9 hours a day which is in a lot doing distance learning for our daughter is crazy especially since we also have a six-month-old son so I won't say that it's not then Insanity in that regard but you know things to definitely worse and I'm just glad to have a little space and you know we're trying to be safe so I think that's really it
724,Jamaica Station that I have is like having my son spending so much time with video games and social media on and spending so much time in his room without any fresh air he's not a lot more paranoid that I thought I did beginning she's not going out at all not even to the balcony and when I go out and get groceries or I went out to get food for a friend that is infected with a virus she got completely paranoid when I came home and he was wearing gloves and a mask and he want to get near me so now you make me paranoid I thought maybe I'm sick and now I started to give him food and disposable plates just in case that was affected I mean I'm not I don't think I am but I'm being super careful but it's happened three times I went out to the supermarket I come back and he doesn't want to be near me so that's frustrating but at the same time I feel like you know we're spending time at home certainly not quality time I am being likely I'm one of the one of those people that it did they go from work I'm I have my job and it's keeping me super busy but I do have the prescription that I can not got them as much homeschooling because she's missing sometimes the classes I wake him up in the morning but he forgets to sign in or he forgets to jump from one class to the other and soon so it's a lot of frustrations around that but you know I come from from a third world country and I I look at the Silver Lining we are home we are we have food to eat and we're healthy compared to all the other people that are losing their lives so I guess at the end or okay
728,I always been inside since May 15th when I have three kids under 5 and I realized how much I relied on little excursions in are going to the store or just going to the library or even the park or you know you're even bigger outings like no chill no kill children's museum near the Aquarium here you know how much I relied on giving them novel experiences as well as preschool I know they went to preschool my two older ones ones preschool three days a week and I feel like that was good for their Social Development so it all kind of Falls to me and I've been worrying about kind of their Social Development which I feel is so important right now I don't really worry about the academic so much cuz I feel like that will that will comebut you know parenting 24-hours is really hard my baby still gets up quite a bit at night and my husband is worse than medicine so he's gone from 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. everyday and he's being Zapped when he gets home and I was apps cuz I got somebody up from you know 5 a.m. until 9 p.m. and then watching the baby so it's um you know and I realize how much those excursions to kind ofhelped me just to not feel so so burnt out and just to increase everybody's mood so I haven't really talked to them very much about what's going on or in a really try to put that that pressure on them not really pressure but just kind of those big feelings that I have about the crisis even though I you know they say they miss their friends and you know before it's interesting before my my four-year-old would have her imaginary play and she would be you know at the star Kingdom or the Rainbow Kingdom or she'd be on mars or something and this fantastic worlds that she would just imagine herself into but but now and she kind of imagines her play it's she's putting herself in you know Costco and she's putting herself at school with her friends or you know these really kind of you know Monday and everyday places that we really took for granted but it's hard it's it's very emotionally and physically and mentally draining and my husband was like you know people did this before I can do women stay at home with their kids but you know but not like this I mean you could go to the store too kind of break up the day you could take him to a park to break up the day I mean you didn't have to really worried about that kind of stuff so it is nice I think at first the pace was nice to not have to run them around their feel like I had to run them around and just kind of connecting back to staying at home and being okay with being at home and my only goal now is just to have give them a good day but it is getting monotonous though it's just more about trying to find them some novel experiences because we're just kind of in this for the Long Haul and I'm not sure when it's going to end but but it is I feel lucky that my only job right now is to hang out with my kids but so is sometimes I do feel guilty about going to being a little bit burnt out but you know I'm with the worried that I have for my husband working in healthcare in and do you know the second wave and when is life going to kind of get back to the place that we can just going to do family outings or you know not worry too much about it so that's just kind of my my issue and how things have changed
730, this whole time has been really interesting I think it's been very challenging from the standpoint of disrupting the say over also to structure of the family lice and I think that that's a really interesting thing to look at because I'm you know I think there's some good things that have come out of it in terms of really looking at how we do school and the way we should have over schedule our children and just the general resources we have in place to sort of deal with with some of the challenges of of educating our kids and and and dealing with mental health issues with children so I think what's happened is in a sort of the general that the basic structures went away and as parents we were faced with this this kind of hot how do we you know you would become homeschooling parents in are we now the teachers I think there was just a lot of unsure Ness about how to deal with this from that perspective I think also in our children's entire social life was now like the way and we became the ones to have to support all their needs in that way as well and I'll and it brought him lots of challenges I think every one of our kids has suffered some mental health issues because of this and they've all man has fell manifest themselves in different ways are somewhere one of our kids really it went into anger and Science and to the point of just not willing to do anything throwing things hurting you know sort of like punching us than me or just being very very physically aggressive and angry another just drove into deep depression and insecurities about yourself you know anything in the world anyone really like to see all these sort of normal sort of high school insecurities were just exacerbated by not being able to have any contact with people sound like video conferences and being isolated in his room or in a room and then my daughter manifest itself and just sort of extreme irritability and just at the drop of a hat just kind of you know having a meltdown you know your old style meltdown but she's not so sure her age also in a text Rena of a stream of sessions about how she look not wanting to appear on video you know I'm sudden concerns about her weight concerns about her appearance I do think was brought on somebody her age but somebody just this need to be on camera all the time but these meetings and just the sort of distance between it's created between doing everything virtually versus actually being in the same room as people and then it's all been cooped up in the same household and having to deal with each other and having to just let go of the Perfection of you know work is work and home is home like working home became sort of the mash together and you know being on call for work with your kids sort of needing something and bugging you and you know it it just it just was not worth it just couldn't be as pretty as you can make it you know when when there's a real clear separation between the work environment in the home environment but some of that was freeing just letting it go let it realizing that everyone was in the same boat or not everyone but a lot of people were in the same boat so I feel like I became more accepting of people who had other challenges due to this and I feel like became more accepting of myself that things weren't going to look as button up as maybe they would otherwise and then I think all our kids have slowly learn to just be more self-sufficient the computer skills to the Moon
732,this has been such a challenging time for me it's scary and I often feel quite depressed and sad because it sometimes feel like there's no end in sight so it's hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel I feel very challenged being in a small New York City apartment with my son I feel really sad for him that he's going through this and that he doesn't get to see any of his friends or just be social and be out and about but we do try to get out everyday we would go free their wokery we just got a bike and some now car going biking some really I feel like it's a necessity for him and it's worth taking the risks of stepping outside but it's beyond challenging and it's really scary and I hope every day for a cure or vaccine to come until then we just you know for the most part we had left the only thing we can do is be helpful so it's some hopefully this will pass
734,hi I live in New York City with my husband on three girls in this is the center of the one of the symptoms of pandemics in the United States and it has been burning really because although we know that the alarm people affected by this pandemic we are said they're not home and we have been very lucky that we only know a few people that got sick and then recovered we have family or friends that have passed away or having very very sick so we would be nice out of x on a little bit of scared too but after of a chance of being Sheltering in we are looking forward to the next phase of moving back to life outside going back to work and being able to do I want number of the team
736,13 of the quarantine and my husband and I have been working from home this entire time. Time and my son has been at home trying to do school and we've been trying to help them in that has been the primary challenge I think before this happened we are finally getting him on track he is kind of getting into activities and supports that he needed and we are seeing so much improvement after a few very rough academic years and this year he's finally you know he was finally loving school and the everyday to go to school and then now you know he's at home and he's happy at home but at the same time yeah he's he's remembering all the worry of you know not doing well in school and all the emotions of me not being challenged at school and you know managing social situation then and now he just wants to stay home becausenot do things that are hard and so he's been in the you know cocooned environment where my husband and I have been helping him with his schoolwork you know as basically like his Perez not that he has parrots cool but it's obvious but he does really well when he has some attention like this but it's been so stressful for us to be basically working shift in the house every day at managing our schedules around that and then you know he's he's also lonely is an only child and You Know It video games until that's become this point of huge struggle like he's here all the time and all he wants to play video games you know it's pulling teeth to get him to sit down and focus on getting stuff done and you know the end of the day my husband and I are just exhausted and we are we are the lucky ones and can make this work you know where the left you it's really tough
738,hi my name is Martin and I have a daughter and a son of 18 + 16 + 1 - 51 I would say one of the fortunate ones living in the country where we have a decent time Hospital service center and also the state to provide us with insurance to cover most of her most of my lost symptoms of thumb describe the crisis that were in to my biggest fear is that my children and their children if they have any not be able to live as freely and think it's really BS open-minded enough to ask I think our generation has been so for not having to talk to that much time crisis facing now and I'm saying that we have. Don't have any problems in the world of course. That's my biggest fear children will not be able to to have the same fishing the future I'm not sharing and then reaching out to to all the countries that support without saying maybe I have a Model S cost Health at home or you can also a bridge for us but it will take some time until we adapt to the to the digital world compared to how are you doing today so I think it's this way until we actually take me to acids and also afraid that the ritual getting richer and the poor people with more poor eventually Maybe having a safety genetically transformed by the by that and being the fridge people have a bigger chance to survive tips of Health in temps of money will a blessed chances of being sick don't worry about my biggest fear something else on my lips okay thanks
740,my greatest concern for my children is that they will not have the opportunity to form social relationships and gain confidence and being in a community of peers while they are home with both summer and also virtual learning and this makes me sad because I think that school and childhood is so much about the social relationships I'm grateful that they have each other as siblings but other than that I feel that this has been a very difficult time as a parent the hardest part is just been finding space to do things other than the required in other words to rest read have fun do things other than work caring for my kids those are the main things that take up the most time right now
742,I as a parent of a 13 year old autistic child I might have a lot of trepidation and concerns going into the remote experience but I'm happy to say that my daughter has adapted extremely well thank goodness and God's blessings for all of the teachers and Educators in the New York City public school system that quickly pulled together and came up with a highly functional and highly effective remote learning capability which has subsequently learned unfortunately wasn't necessarily the case for kids and parochial and private school or other states are very grateful for that she's adapted to the most learning extremely well has gotten into a great routine and has been showing up for class regularly and got into a great Rhythm and all of her teachers Eva martelle engage cheers so we're grateful to that I'm grateful to be able to have a place to run to outside of New York City that alleviates a lot of concern and anxiety and I were just so grateful my life and I that our daughter has been able to maintain happiness she misses our friends but thanks to products like Zoom she probably talk to them or off and then for necessarily so we're both very fortunate
744,I'm a freelance writer and I live in New York City houses for rent with chives and being outdoors I love getting drinks during happy hours with them and watching movies very stressful this has made me extremely anxious that would be nice when ambulance sirens have kept me and my roommate's up believe that this will pass I started my blessings every day and being grateful for my health and the health of my loved onesI have volunteered at Community have delivered groceries and medicine to immunocompromised and senior people and served as an interpreter between medical professionals and non-english-speaking patients we don't owe any productivity in this time people are not merely working from home to a crisis and since there should underline every bit of the crisis management processes Jermaine essential Envy as a fancy and as a community that had fight for their ages Deimos and rice pandemic or no pain dentist
746, I just want to talk about this and I'm making how it affects the students in my view I think being at home. Alone for three months maybe four months and sometimes not even going outside at all it has to have a lot of bad effects emotionally socially the physical fitness academically of course and all that together is I think it's too much that's why I want the schools to open up as soon as possible I hope they will be like scene that's going to be effective and successful team will be here within a few months thank you
748,I don't know if this is on but I'm glad to be here and try to express some of what I've been going through recently I moved out of my retirement home on March 8th and I've been staying with my son and his family since then I'm only a short bike ride away from the house where I live normally but I feel a world away 4 weeks I was struggle with terrible nightmares they were the kind of nightmares that get you up and moving into action for several minutes before you realize that the thing to which are responding was not real not substantially real each nightmare seem to get worse I started with mudslides then came the Holocaust torturing a mass genocide and then one night last week was the worst I woke up realizing that I had caused the pandemic I posted about this problem of the nightmares online and I received several comments and suggestions and I think now that the nightmares were caused by having the room too warm when I slept I was responding to messages about warmth and humidity being good for discouraging the virus so now I seem to have that problem licked and it had nothing nothing more complicated than cooling off the room nightmares have been the worst part of this for me I posted to a face group Facebook group asking for pictures of the view from my window and this may this group meets regularly and post views of what they see out their window and then has some comments I posted the view out my window which is a trash can I said a little something about how this view is one view of the one window from the guest room is special and wonderful to me because it means I'm with family my response got to six and a half thousand likes and about 500 or more comments from all around the world and they were all very positive and supporting none of the spam or personal attacks that's the first time in my experience that anyway it was really very tonight I'm hosting a zoom party for the residents of my retirement home it's the first non annual virtual TGIF blank retirement home party I've been hosting a once-a-week poetry Gathering and people have seen very glad of that and so today one rolled me of her claustrophobia and I thought you know we don't need any excuse even poetry which is the best excuse ever is we can just party so I'm looking forward to it I really appreciate this chance to express what's on my mind and I I hope to do this again I think it's a great experiment and I hope that it's another way of bonding and sharing with people potentially around the world and I send them all you all my love thank you and bye
750,I am a parent of a 5th grader going into 6th grade and a son with autism and it be 75 program and I am frustrated that remote learning has taken the joy of learning away from my daughter she hates it and my son was making amends strides in his d75 program has now regressed instead of progress and is losing all of his decoding skills and is now back to reading at a third-grade level my husband is in a sense of workers you work for the MTA we worry every day that he will bring something home or that he will be hurt in some way in the way things are running right nowmy brother-in-law had already contracted covet and it took him three weeks to recover enough to go back to work and he's still not at 100% we've lost family members and close family friends to the disease already and between that and seeing the social injustice and unrest that is happening around this right now has left me and my family in a constant turmoil of stress and loss and grief and as much as we try to keep things happy in life for children the children feel it too and it's some some days are easier than others but I am really hoping we find Solutions and some relief very soon thank you for the opportunity to speak

754,so today is May 20th and has been over for about two months into the two that makes up knocked down I have two young children attend boys of the age of 9 + 6 + New York City and I have mixed feelings about the current situation first I was trying to remain very positive about the whole situation and trying to get down to somestructure when it started and nobody though I think down my children are still in the age where they're not independent my older one I always have to check on his homework to make sure that he doesn't divert on to a different websites and I think my main struggle in our house is managing his iPad time which is for him a way to stay connected with his friendsbut it's the same he done cannot he's off-limits and that makes it really hard and also I could see my younger one 6 is my more stuffing about not seeing his friends and having play dates so like yesterday right now I feel there is just too much screen in the in our lives and I would like to do something else then everything that has limitations now let's say we are in small apartment and we can go very far or even the walks are starting to be boring so and then finally it's like personally I don't feel like I have the time to take care of myself time to the vittra group. no to that you just take care of myself and I was safe finally I everyday I'm like when will will see him then to this pandemic because I think if we start to have an idea about what will come next and we'll just helped to make the other projects
